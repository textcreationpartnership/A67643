            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Infancy of the world nothing was thought Painfull, or Afflicting to man but Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; Death: now he is Greived, if he wants any thing, he affects: the Riches of nature are Scarce able to content his Deſires, &amp; even whem he hath all things neceſſary, he thinks himſelf Poore, if he wants any thing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. <hi>Craſſus</hi> was the Richeſt of the Romans, yet thought himſelf Poore becauſe there were ſome riches, not his owne: ſoe he paſt terrible Deſerts to make war to Nations, whoſe only crime was their Wealth. To <hi>Alexander</hi> the whole Earth ſeemed little, &amp; having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered it, he wept, hearing there were other worlds undiſcovered. <hi>Achab,</hi> King of a greate Kingdome, was ſoe <hi>heavy,</hi> &amp; <hi>greived,</hi> that he could not eate, becauſe one refuſed, to ſell him a ſmall plot of ground, <hi>to plant herbs in.</hi> Thus man finds a torment, in his felicity, &amp; when he is moſt Fortunate, he becomes ſoe tender, that althô his Attempts are ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet even in them he finds pretexts to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
<pb facs="tcp:102635:3"/>&amp; his greateſt ſucceſſes are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with ſome circumſtances which afflict him. He is not content with a victory: becauſe the Commander of the Enemyes ſaved himſelf by flyght, &amp; did not Looſe his life, or liberty, with his Honour. The enemy's navy is beaten: yet that ſatisfyes him not, becauſe ſome of their ships recovered their Haven. A towne is taken: yet he is troubled, that the whole Province, with it, did not receive the yoke. Yet ſuppoſe his ſatisfaction entire in one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, that will only ſtirre him up to new Projects. The death of one Deſire, is the birth of another: He uſes his Reaſon only to invent new Tortures to his Hart, by propoſing new Objects to his Will, which deprive him of all contentment in what he hath, whileſt he proſecutes his deſignes, to obtaine what he hath not.</p>
            <p>His Deſire of Honour is no leſſe inſatiable. A ſcholler thinks the time, he ſpends in ſtudys loſt, unleſſe he be pointed at in the ſtreetes, &amp; ſaluted as a Rabby. His vertu it ſelfe ſeemes not ſatisfyed with the teſtimony of a good Conſcience: &amp; unleſſe with the Approbation of Heaven, he hath the applauſe of the Earth, he thinks himſelfe wronged. Nay should all generally applaude him, if only one detract, it ſpoyles all the Satisfaction he takes in the commendations of the reſt. To <hi>Haman</hi> all knees were bent in the whole Empire of <hi>Perſia,</hi> except thoſe of <hi>Mardochai:</hi> &amp; the trouble of
<pb facs="tcp:102635:3"/>this banisht all the content he found in the ſubmiſſion of the reſt. He conſidered the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſſe of his Riches, the Glory of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the number of his children, the Queene's kindneſſe; &amp; the King's favour, who had rayſed him a bove all the reſt of the Princes: Yet <hi>all avayled him nothing, as long, as he ſaw Mardochai ſitting at the King's gate,</hi> Heſter. 5.13. Hence he tooke a Reſolution, to rid the country of him, &amp; all his kindred, the whole Iewish Nation, the only faithfull people, &amp; viſible church of that time.</p>
            <p>The Proceedings of <hi>Proteſtant Miniſters</hi> in order to <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> are not unlike to thoſe of <hi>Haman</hi> with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> &amp; diſcover as greate, as inſatiable an Ambition. They have turned us out of the churchs we had built, &amp; founded, shut us out of their Courts, excluded us out of their Armys, barred againſt us all entry into their Navys, by getting us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared incapable of Civill, and Military em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, of all offices honourable, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall. By which meanes, no Papiſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their ordinary publick meetings, all knees are bent to them. Yet all this auayles not theſe meeke men, as long as a Papiſt is ſeene to walke in the ſtreetes, or knowne to breath Inglish ayre. Soe the country muſt be rid of us. Thus far the Paralel runs juſt betwixt <hi>Haman,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Miniſters</hi> on the one ſide, &amp; the <hi>Iſraelits,</hi> &amp; <hi>Catholicks,</hi> on the other. Yet there occurre two differences: one that I
<pb facs="tcp:102635:4"/>never <hi>Reade</hi> that <hi>Haman</hi> had bin enriched with the ſpoyles of the Jews; &amp; the Benefices our Miniſters enjoy were founded by Catholycks. The other, that <hi>Haman</hi> contented himſelf, with punishing the bodys of the Jews, &amp; our Miniſters doe more over perſecute our ſouls. Soe that the Proceedings of theſe our friends are more <hi>uniuſt</hi> in their cauſe, &amp; more <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane</hi> in their effects.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Gilbert Burnet</hi> gives this verdict, for <hi>Banishing us in this World,</hi> &amp; <hi>Damning us in the next.</hi> But our Comfort is, that there lyes an Appeale from his Sentence to the Tribunal of God, as to what concernes the next world: &amp; to the mercy of the King, &amp; Equity of the Parliament, &amp; Judges, as to what concernes this. We hope, they will not by banishing ſoe many Peeres of the Realme, &amp; worthy Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen avoyde the diſturbance of Mr. Burnet, who gives no other motive why we should be banisht, then that <hi>we diſturbe them.</hi> Let thoſe, to whome of Ryght it belongs, conſider what reward this man's preſumption deſerves, who being borne out of the Kingdome, (as <hi>Haman</hi> was, Heſter 16.10.) &amp; lately by favour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in to it, should have the Confidence to pronounce ſo ſevere a ſentence uppon ſoe conſiderable a part of it. What may not be expected from his boldneſſe, when he is deeper rooted in England, &amp; hath gotten more Credit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haman</hi> alleadged againſt the <hi>Iews</hi> two points
<pb facs="tcp:102635:4"/>1. That their <hi>Religion</hi> was different from that of the State (which thing was tru; but it was alſo Innocent) 2. Their <hi>diſobedience to the King's laws:</hi> which was a <hi>Calumny.</hi> But his maine motive, was the ſtifneſſe of <hi>Mardochai</hi>'s knees; which he concealed; but God revealed. And M.B. alleadges two faults againſt us <hi>points of our Religion</hi> (which are tru, but harmeleſſe) &amp; <hi>Calumnyes,</hi> as by this Treatiſe will appeare. And there is greate reaſon to ſuſpect ſome other motive, which in the treatiſe will shew it ſelf. No doubt, but <hi>Haman</hi> pretended <hi>greife</hi> to find ſoe much <hi>disloyalty</hi> amongſt the <hi>Iews,</hi> as Mr. G.B. pretends for the <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt hath revealed in ſcripture the hypocriſy of the one; &amp; I will leave to the ſame Divine Spirit the Judgment of the other.</p>
            <p>The paralel running ſo juſt, betwixt <hi>Haman,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mr. Burnet,</hi> the reader ſees the reaſon why I give the name of <hi>Anti-Haman,</hi> to this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. I declare, that I have no intention to offend his perſon, by that name, or any thing elſe in the whole, further then the matter I ſpeake of after him forces me.</p>
            <p>In my anſwer I follow G.B. ſtep by ſtep: &amp; to shew I doe not alter his ſenſe, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the ſtrength of his arguments, I put them downe in his owne words. I divide my worke into chapters, that I myght be the better underſtood: &amp; to avoyde tedious Repetitions of the ſame things, which S. Cyril
<pb facs="tcp:102635:5"/>reproached to Julian the Apoſtata, l. 2. <hi>initio,</hi> &amp; may with as much reaſon be reproached to Mr. B. ſeing he objects our ſaying <hi>Prayers in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> pag. 32. 35. 80. 115. 121. &amp; 131. The like of <hi>Attrition, Prayers to Saints, Idolatry, Maſſe, Indulgences, &amp;c.</hi> which are always at hand to fill up a Period, &amp; encreaſe the bulke of his booke, which would dwindle to an inconſiderable bigneſſe, if that repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were auoyded.</p>
            <p>The Booke hath very little new, it renews commonly the old objections, which have bin often baffled by our controvertiſts. <hi>Trita haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticorum arma colligit.</hi> S. Proſper: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes not from want of wit, or Study (in both he abounds) but from the nature of his cauſe, which is capable of no better Defence. For this reaſon I may be excuſed, if I am short in my replyes. Yet ſometimes I shall enlarge, where ether the difficulty it ſelf, or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of urging it, is ſingular.</p>
            <p>Such is the reproach of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which is old, having bin objected to the Cat. Church, by the ancient <hi>Iconoclaſts,</hi> &amp; by the firſt of our late Reformers: yet it appeares of late in ſuch adreſſe, as it may ſeeme quite new. Heretofore all acknoledged the <hi>Pagan Idolatry</hi> to have conſiſted in the worship of <hi>Idols,</hi> or <hi>Divils.</hi> Calvin ſayd,<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <hi>the Pagans were perſwaded that in their Idols they adored their falſe Gods, which they thought
<pb facs="tcp:102635:5"/>reſided in Heaven.</hi> He thought then, they were <hi>false Gods.</hi> The ſame was the opinion of thoſe, who followed, till of late that ſome new men pretend that the <hi>Iupiter</hi> of the Pagans, was <hi>the tru God:</hi> &amp; all others were only names of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> or <hi>Mediating Spirits.</hi> I find none of this opinion, before <hi>Mr. Stillingfleete,</hi> nether hath he long bin of it, for an. 1663. when he printed his <hi>Origenes Sacrae,</hi> he held the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as I will shew hereafter. Till he shews his Authour, we may call this the <hi>Stillingflee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian error. Magnum Stillingfleeti Incrementum.</hi> And I Deſire him to shew any Chriſtian, who ever ſayd: <q>
                  <hi>I adore the Pagan Iupiter,</hi> Did ever any Martyr profeſſe that he beleived in, &amp; adored <hi>Iupiter,</hi> as well, as his Judges, or the Emperors did; but refuſed only to adore his ſtatues, becauſe he himfelf by his law, Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di 20.4. had forbidden it? Or ſayd, the reaſon why they refuſed to Sacrifice Beaſts or offer incenſe to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> was becauſe he, (<hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelf,) required of them other ſortes of <hi>Adoration?</hi> No certainly. Yet thoſe are the thoughts which would naturally have occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red had both partyes agreed in profeſſing the ſame <hi>one tru God;</hi> &amp; had only differred about the manner of worshipping him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is my firſt reaſon againſt E.S. his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox. A Second is that the Controverſy betwixt Chriſtians &amp; Pagans had bin quite altred, had what he ſays bin tru. We ſind them diſputing about the pretended Divinity of

Now this Point could never have bin diſputed, had both partyes agreed, that the thing ſignifyed by the Name <hi>Iupiter,</hi> had bin the one tru God, &amp; all the difference had bin about that name. <hi>As de facto</hi> no Chriſtian ever diſputed with the Turkes, about the Being of one only God, becauſe they call him not, as we doe, <hi>Deus,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> but <hi>Alla.</hi> This hint gives us a fayre proſpect into the ſentiments of Chriſtian Antiquity: for all Diſputants both Chriſtians, &amp; Pagans muſt have ſpoken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, if what E. S. ſays be tru.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon, &amp; the ſtrongeſt of all, is, that as E. S. States the Controverly, Pagans were in the ryght &amp; Chriſtians in the wrong. For, what ſayd the Chriſtians? <hi>Iupiter was a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, &amp; is a filthy Divil.</hi> What ſayd the Pagans? <hi>Iupiter is the tru God.</hi> Now what is the reall truth, according to E. S.? <hi>Iupiter in the tru God, bleſſed for evermore.</hi> By which words he gives-in Evidence for the Pagans, againſt the Apoſtles, who in opoſition to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> &amp; the whole rabble of ſuch like fictitious Divinitys, planted the Chriſtian Faith: againſt the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Martyrs, who watred it with their blood:
<pb facs="tcp:102635:6"/>againſt the ancient Fathers, who defended it with their writings: againſt the Primitive Church, which profeſt it, amidſt the greateſt Perſecutions: againſt God himſelf, who by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Graces, &amp; viſible Miracles confirmed it, &amp; laſtly againſt that very <hi>Iupiter,</hi> (for whome he pleades) who owned himſelf to be <hi>a filthy Divil.</hi> What cenſure can be toe ſevere, for ſo rash a verdict? Seing by it, the Pagans are abſolved, &amp; the Chriſtians condemned, &amp; this by a pretended Profeſſor of Chriſtianity, &amp; an Aſſertor of its primitive Purity.</p>
            <p>Imagin your ſelf (to E. S. I ſpeake) to be brought into agreate Aſſembly, where all the Faithfull ſouls of the three firſtages were met, where, on the oneſide were placed the glorious Martyrs, in ſcarlet robes, deyed in their owne blood: on the other Renowned Doctors &amp; Fathers in white shining garments, ſymbols of the lyght of their Doctrine, which directs the Ignorant to Heaven: at the upper end, the Apoſtles, &amp; Evangeliſts, &amp; neere them the 72. Diſciples: &amp; all the reſt ſtood in the middle. Think that all fix their eyes on you (&amp; doubtleſſe from Heaven they do ſo) as on the firſt man, who retaining the name of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> aſſerted the Error they overthrew, &amp; oppoſed the Truth, they upheld, viz, that <hi>Iupiter was not God, but ether a wicked man, or a filthy Divil.</hi> Imagin they ſay unto you: <q>How happens it, that our cauſe, which for ſo many ages triumpht over Impiety, should now fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:102635:7"/>it, being arraigned at the Bar, of your Iudgment, &amp; there found Guilty? How chances it, that we, the Martyrs, should have ſpilt our blood: we, the Doctors, have employed our wit, ſtudyes, &amp; utmoſt induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: we, the Apoſtles &amp; Diſciples, have ſpent our labours, &amp; whole liues: we, the faithfull, expoſed our ſelves to the greateſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to deſtroy the Kingdome of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who you ſay, was <hi>the tru God?</hi> What excuſe can you alleadge for this fact, of which you find us guilty, viz, firſt, of denying <hi>the tru God:</hi> ſecondly of accuſing him, of <hi>Incest, Adultery, Rapes, Sodomy, Rebellion, Parricide,</hi> &amp; what not? all which we charged on <hi>Iupiter,</hi> by an unparallelled Blaſphemy, if he be God. And (which aggravates our crime) we all continued obſtinate in aſſerting theſe Blaſphemys, even to our laſt gaſpe, &amp; breathed out our ſouls, in finall Impenitency. To what place will you ſentence us, after our death whome you find quilty of ſuch foul crimes during our life? To Heaven? Blaſphemy, accompanyed with finall Impenitency can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter it. To the Ayre? our ſins would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file it. To the Earth? we are un worthy to treade uppon it. Hell, Hell is the only fit place for us, if yet Hell it ſelf hath any tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments proportioned to ſo hainous offences.</q> What reply can you make to this? with what eyes can you looke on them?</p>
            <p>Should he thence paſſe into an Aſſembly of
<pb facs="tcp:102635:7"/>Pagan Idolaters, <hi>Iupiter</hi> the Arch-Divil, (or <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi>) preſiding over them; with what Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would he be received! How would they rejoice for ſo noted a Proſelite! How would the Preſident renew his hopes of recovering that throne, by the helpe of ſo able a man, which he affected from the beginning, <hi>in the ſides of the north</hi> (Iſay 14.13.) whence he was beaten by the Spirit of God, working in, &amp; with the Primitive Chriſtians! That <hi>Satan</hi> was for a time to be bound, &amp; after Looſed againe, we reade Apoc. 20.3. Such Doctrine, as this, (that he is the tru God) gives a greate blow to his chaine. And what diſpoſitions there are at preſent to entertaine him, all know, <hi>Libertiniſme, Blaſphemy,</hi> &amp; all <hi>Impiety</hi> walking bare-faced, men glorying in them, ſeeme to provoke our Juſt God to punish theſe ſins, by that other, <hi>Paganiſme:</hi> &amp; the multitudes flocking to ſuch <hi>Conventicles,</hi> as have little of Chriſtianity more then the name, diſcover how looſely many of the people are united to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; that there are greate diſpoſitions to a generall <hi>Apoſtaſy:</hi> which I am perſwaded E.S. would be as ſorry to ſee happen in his days, as any other. Yet leaſt (althô againſt his will) he should promote ſee greate a miſcheife,</p>
            <p>I wish he renounce this Paradox otherwiſe that it be writ uppon his Tombe: <hi>Here Lyeth a Champion of the Reformed Church of Ingland, who Beleived in, &amp; Adored no other God, but the Pagan Iupiter.</hi>

            <p> I deſigne no formall anſwer to his <hi>Defence of the Diſcourſe of Idolatry,</hi> His able Antagoniſt needes no helpe from my Weakeneſſe: ſo I let him end the diſpute, he hath ſo happily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged hitherto. Yet if I am not miſtaken, I shall lay ſuch principles, as may ſerve for an anſwer to that booke: For ſeing the manner of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the matter is new, I have taken the liberty to be Longer in it, then elſewhere. It may be he will (having reade what I ſay) find a reaſon to change his Judgment of us, that we can ſay nothing, but out of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or <hi>Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius.</hi> It is no hard matter, to ſatisfy any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man, in that point, it being ſo cleere in Antiquity, that if we reade <hi>Iustinus,</hi> M. or <hi>Athenagoras, Tertullian,</hi> or <hi>S. Cyprian, Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Felix,</hi> or <hi>Arnobius, S. Auſtin,</hi> or <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> we shall every where find convincing proofes of the falshood of that Errour. It may be, ſome may take the paynes to publish ſome of thoſe Greate men's treatiſes, in Inglish, for the publick good: to shew the World, Mr. Stil. 's Ingenuity in handling Controverſy. Now if he hath the Confidence to falſify ſo <hi>cleere a matter of fact,</hi> teſtifyed by <hi>Scripture,</hi> by <hi>Fathers,</hi> by <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> by <hi>Pagans,</hi> by the <hi>Divils</hi> them ſelves, and acknowledged by thoſe of his owne Communion, how can he be relyed on in <hi>Points of Doctrine,</hi> which are more diſputable, as being more obnoxious to miſtakes, &amp; not capable of ſo cleere diſproofes? He could not poſſibly have given greater cauſe, to ſuſpect
<pb facs="tcp:102635:8"/>all he writes, then by ſuch a <hi>Paradox,</hi> ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently falſe, &amp; ſo confidently aſſerted.</p>
            <p>One thing I deſire of our adverſaryes, for their owne ſakes that they regard a little what write, &amp; not fill their bookes with every thing that occurres, tru, or falſe. I shall take notice of Mr. B. in the tract. <hi>Mr. Whithy</hi> in the title Page of his booke cites as <hi>Scotus</hi> his Opinion, an <hi>Objection</hi> which he makes, &amp; anſwers. He myght with like reaſon have cited him, &amp; all Divines for Atheiſme ſeing all put ſome Objections againſt the Being of a God: &amp; all Proteſtant writers of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, for <hi>Popery,</hi> ſeing out of them, Papiſt objections may be taken. Again pag. 242. he ſays no ancient Father <hi>takes notice of any Heathen objecting to Chriſtians their Prayers to Saints: which is an aſſurance,</hi> ſays he, <hi>there was no ſuch practice.</hi> Yet S. Auguſtin twice takes notice of that objection, l. 8. <hi>de Civit. Dei</hi> c. 27. &amp; l. 20. <hi>contra Fauſt.</hi> c. 21. As alſo S. Hierome ep. 53. ad Riparium, &amp; lib. cont. Jovinian. c. 2. Againe in the ſame page he aſſures <hi>there was no mention of canonizing Saints, till the</hi> 7. <hi>century.</hi> Yet the ſchiſme of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi> was in the beginning of the 4. century, &amp; a greate cauſe of this ſchiſme was the malice, &amp; ſpyght of <hi>Lucilla,</hi> a factious, proud, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich woman, who was reprehended by <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> then a Deacon, for honouring the bone of a <hi>Martyr</hi> before he was <hi>Canonized, Os Martyris nondum vindicati,</hi> ſays <hi>Optatus Milevit.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102635:9"/>l. 1. &amp; may be ſeene in S. Aug. l. 1. cont. Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian. cap. 3. &amp; epiſt. 162. Moreover out of the Iliberitan Council can. 60. &amp; S. Auſtin. Brevic. collat. die 3. c. 13. is gathered that the African, &amp; Spanish Churchs would not admit into the number of Martyrs (which was their <hi>Canonizing</hi> them) ſuch as loſt their lives, having provoked the Perſecutors to kill them. Soe in the third age there was the cuſtome of <hi>Canonizing:</hi> for the Council of <hi>Eliberis,</hi> or <hi>Elvira</hi> &amp; <hi>Optatus</hi> ſpeake of it, as of a cuſtome eſtablisht. This being ſoe cleere, &amp; ſoe obvious, I cannot gueſſe what should ground <hi>Mr. Whitby's</hi> miſtake of no cuſtome to <hi>Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize</hi> before the 7. century, unleſſe it was that he found in <hi>Bellar.</hi> l. 1. de Sanct. Beatit. or in <hi>Surius</hi> his life of <hi>S. Swithbert,</hi> that this Saint was the firſt of whoſe ſolemne <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation</hi> any records are extant. Which yet is far, from what <hi>Mr. Whitby</hi> affirmes, of <hi>no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cuſtome of Canonizing till the</hi> 7. <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</hi> Such groſſe errours beare the character of a <hi>Miniſter fryghted with Popery, &amp; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt it:</hi> none elſe are capable of them. I have reade very little in that worke: for opening it accidentally in that place, where thoſe two greate untruths are ſo confidently advanced, that brought to my mind the words of the <hi>wiſe man,</hi> Prov. 29.20. So I thought I myght ſpend my time better, then on him.</p>
            <p>One word to preuent misinterpretations.
<pb facs="tcp:102635:9"/>In the following treatiſe, I put W. L. for <hi>Will. Lawd</hi> late <hi>Lord Primate of Ingland</hi> (as alſo E. S. for <hi>D.

Which none can be offended with, who knows, we cite in alike manner <hi>Bellarmin, Baronius, Perron, Cayetan,</hi> without their titles, notwithſtanding their Eccleſiaſticall dignity.</p>
            <p>Selfe defence is of the law of nature, &amp; is never leſſe obnoxious to Cenſure, then when leaſt perſonall: And ſuch is my caſe; whoſe only endeauour is, to pleade for the <hi>Cat.

In the handling it, I have avoyded, as much as poſſible all perſonall Reflections, which are not forced on me by the booke, I anſwer.

                  <hi>CHAPTER I.</hi> G. B. his deſigne, &amp; diſpoſition when he writ this Booke: of the wickedneſſe of the world.</head>
               <p>MR. G.B. page 1. <q>
                     <hi>He that increaſeth knowledge, incraſeth ſorrow,</hi> is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation which holdeth true of no part of knowledge, ſo much as of the knowledge of mankind: it is ſome relief to him, who knows nothing of foreigne wickedneſſe, to hope there are other nations where in vertu is honoured, &amp; Religion is in eſteeme, which allays his regrates when he ſees Vice, &amp; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety abound in his country; but if by travelling or reading, he enlarge his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, &amp; know mankind better, his regrates will grow, when he finds the whole world lyes in wickedneſſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. We neede not travell, or read much, to know, that <hi>the whole world lyes in wickedneſſe:</hi> Seing thoſe are the words of the beloyed diſciple, 1. Jo. 5.19. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102635:11"/>an occaſion of ſorrow. But in the ſame place the B. Apoſtle comforts us, by ſaying <hi>we know that we are of God.</hi> Soe that <hi>the world</hi> there is underſtood of <hi>unbeleivers:</hi> who are in <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> by originall &amp; actuall ſin, for which they haue no lawfull, &amp; efficacious expiation, no Sacrament inſtituted by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghty God lawfully adminiſtred. But we, who are in the tru Church, <hi>are of God,</hi> unto whome we are regenerated by Baptiſme; &amp; if by humane frailly we dye to God falling into any greivous ſin, we have the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Pennance to rayſe us againe to the life of Grace.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not the Apoſtles meaning, that in the tru members of the Catholick Church there is nothing reprehenſible; or that in thoſe, who are not in it there is nothing Good. In Heaven there is nothing but Vertu, thoſe Bleſſed ſouls having their will ſoe united to that of God, that they cannot offend him. In Hell there is nothing but ſin: the wills of thoſe wretched Spirits being ſoe obſtinate in the love of themſelves, that they cannot doe any thing which should pleaſe God. This preſent life is a meane betwixt thoſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: &amp; in it there is a mixture of Perfections &amp; imperfections, of vice &amp; vertu. Thoſe, who are moſt wicked have ſomething good: &amp; in thoſe, who are moſt vertuous, there are ſome remainders of Humane frailty, for their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102635:11"/>Humiliation, which we ought nether to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme, nor imitate.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Kings</hi> 21.25.</note> 
                  <hi>There was none like unto Achab, which did ſell him ſelf to work wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the ſyght of the Lord.</hi> Yet <hi>he humbled himſelfe &amp; put on ſackcloth, &amp; fasted.</hi> S. Paul<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15.</note> 
                  <hi>The choſen veſſell unto God to beare his name before the Gentils, &amp; Kings, &amp; the children of Iſrael, yet</hi>

                  <hi>there was given to him a thorne in the flesh, the meſſenger of Satan, to buffet him.</hi> And who can without compaſſion reade his ſeventh chapter to the Romans, in which he deſcribes the conflict he felt interiourly, betwixt the Spirit, &amp; the flesh? Which he concludes with theſe pathetick words: <hi>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> which renew the memory of that torment, to which Mezentius the tyrant<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Virgilius Aeneid. <hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his innocent ſubjects: &amp; the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſcans<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Aug. l. <hi>4.</hi> contra Iul. c. ult.</note> exerciſed uppon their captives: binding living bodyes to rotten putrifyed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes, &amp; leaving them ſoe. But the Apoſtle, who deſcribes his paine, relates his eaſe, &amp; having explicated his ſickneſſe acquaints us with its Remedy, <hi>the grace of God, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> So that if the combat affryghts us, by this aſſiſtance we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, &amp; comforted.</p>
               <p>Yet though I grant that there is occaſion enough, to lament on what ſide ſoever we caſt our eyes on mankind, in this ſtate of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102635:12"/>corrupt nature, if we conſider how little men uſe the meanes deſigned for their improvement in vertu, &amp; reſiſting their bad inclinations. Yet there is little appearance of greife in your booke: which hath more of a <hi>Satyre</hi> them of a <hi>Lamentation,</hi> your ſtile being rather bitingly invective, then mourningly compaſſionate: you diſcover more of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> or of <hi>Democritus,</hi> then of <hi>Heraclitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Were there no objects of <hi>regrate</hi> neerer home? Doth your owne Church afford you no occaſion to shew your Zeale, in blaming the faults of her children, in order to get them corrected? Sure it doth, or the world is very much miſinformed. How comes it then, that you neglect her cure, of whome your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter oblidges you to have a care; &amp; Search the ſores of the Roman Church, with which you have nothing to doe? Doe you not ſee that you give us reaſon, to ſay, your Charity is diſorderly, not beginning at home: &amp; that<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 6.42.</note> as the Hypocrit, you labour to shew in, or take out of <hi>anothers eye, a mote,</hi> while you neglect <hi>a beame</hi> in your owne?</p>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. What <hi>temper</hi> then doth it <hi>argue</hi> to <hi>delyght</hi> in repreſenting them, &amp; that in the moſt horrible, tragicall, &amp; diſmall colours,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102635:12"/>which art, and ſtudy, can invent? for what can even the moſt inventive Imagination fancy more diſmall, then what you write pag. 2. <hi>Indignityes done to God, &amp; his Son Chriſt, the enemy of mankind triumphing over the world with abſolute authority; &amp; enraged cruelty: Satan have a ſeate, when Chriſts throne should be: Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fallen from its firſt love, &amp; the greateſt part of it made shipwrack of its Faith: that Church, whoſe Faith was once ſpoken of throughout the world, become Mother of the Fornications of the Earth.</hi> In fine, <hi>Falling away, myſtery of iniquity, AntiChriſt, Babilonish Rome, Bewitchings, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceryes,</hi> &amp; what not. Adde but obſtinacy in theſe horrid crimes (which is a circumſtance aggravating them, without altring their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies) &amp; the Paynes due to ſin (which are not horrible, if compared with ſin) &amp; we here have a picture of Hell.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>temper</hi> is very <hi>mercifull,</hi> &amp; <hi>humane,</hi> which ptompts you to make ſuch a map of the fargreateſt part of Chriſtianity! This will appeare more cleerely, when we come to conſider your charge in retayle, &amp; examin your proofes, when we ſee you are forced to ſeeke them in the obſcure withdrawing roomes of man's hart, which are inacceſſible to all, but God, of which nevertheleſſe you ſpeake as confidently, as if God had lead you by the hand into them; &amp; made you partaker of his knowledge. <hi>Purgatory was invented</hi> on

                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.21.22.</note> 
                  <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> &amp; <hi>falſe Chriſts.</hi> Who should ſay: <hi>Loe here is Chriſt: Loe he is there.</hi> All Sectarys pretend to him. You will doubtleſſe ſay, he is in your Prelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Church: the Presbyterian ſays he is in his Aſſemblyes: The independant is for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles: the Quaker Claimes him alſo. What shall a Roman Catholike doe? what choice shall he make? Our Bleſſed Saviour having forewarned us of the danger, armes us againſt it: <hi>Ne credideritis: beleive none of them;</hi> but ſticke to the old Doctrine, &amp; the Catholick Church. Which I cite, as more againſt you, then any thing, you can bring againſt us, out of your contemplations on <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Apocalypſe:</hi> to which you would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, had you any cleere grounds againſt us in Scripture. I ſuſpect the cauſe of any man, which to decide a ſuite-in-law, produces
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102635:14"/>obſcure, dubious, &amp; (for that reaſon) inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant <hi>deedes.</hi> I should on that ſcore, had others beene wanting, ſuſpect the cauſe of the ſectaryes, millenarians, fift-monarky-men, &amp; the like. And that reaſon is ſufficient to make me ſuſpect you, who recurre to thoſe obſcure Prophecyes of the AntiChriſt: which at beſt are extremely obſcure: as appeares by the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, grounded on it as you acknowledge: For you ſay:</p>
               <p>G.B. pag. 3. <hi>Some have ſtretched the notion of AntiChriſtiamiſme ſo far, that things harmleſſe, &amp; innocent, come with in its compaſſe: &amp; others have too much contracted it, that they myght ſcape free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. It ſeemes the limits of the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of AntiChriſtianiſme</hi> are very arbitrary, ſoing they are extn ded, or contracted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (not to Scripture, or Tradition, but) to the fancy, &amp; caprichio of every pragmaticall Heade. When you conſider more impartially the <hi>things harmeleſſe &amp; Innocent,</hi> which you blame in us as AntiChriſtian, very probably, you will find your ſelfe to be of the number of thoſe, who ſtretch its notion beyond its nature, &amp; thoſe limits, which God hath deſigned for it.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 3. <hi>AntiChriſtianiſme is not only a bare contradiction to ſome branches, or parts, of the Ghoſpel; but a deſigne &amp; entire complex, of ſuch opinions, &amp; practices, as are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102635:14"/>to, &amp; ſubverſive of, the power &amp; life of Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Never did Junior Sophiſter amongſt illiterate Peſants, deliver his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Apollo amongſt his deluded Adorers, ſpeake his Oracles, more magiſterially, then you deliver your Opinions in controverted matters, of Faith: for ſuch is this point, ſeing it is delivered in Scripture, &amp; there are ſuch variety of perſwaſions concerning it's tru meaning, as you your ſelfe ſayd even now. You give us a new notion of it &amp; what Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what Tradition, what decree of a Councill, what father, doe you alleadge for it? None. Not ſoe much as any reaſon offred. Is not this to Lord it over the faith of your Reader? To beg the thing in queſtion? &amp; to expect the world should be ſo ſtupid, as to be taken with ſuch a ſlyght? That you should meete with beleife, becauſe you boldly aſſert?</p>
               <p>To your bare aſſertion, I will oppoſe my negation: &amp; why should not my negation be be of as much weyght, as your affirmation? Eſpecially ſeing I ſpeake with all thoſe, whome you blame for enlarging, or contrac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting too much the notion of AntiChriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme; &amp; you ſtand alone. I confirme my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation with Scripture 1. Jo. 4.3. where thoſe are ſayd to be AntiChriſt, who <hi>deny Chriſt's coming in the flesh.</hi> Which is only one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102635:15"/>article of Chriſtianity, how ſoever it be of the moſt fundamentall.</p>
               <p>Yet let us grant, what you ſoe confidently beg, that Anti-Chriſtianiſme is acomplex of opinions oppoſed to the power, &amp; life of Chriſtianity. I know none, who hath better title to it, then your Reformation: for the life of Chriſtianity, is <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>Charity:</hi> &amp; you have deſtroyed the firſt by <hi>Hereſy,</hi> &amp; the ſecond by <hi>Schiſme,</hi> as shall be proved hereafter.</p>
               <p>Children delyght in Edged tooles, which ſerve only to cut their fingers: &amp; you, &amp; your brethren, uſe weapons againſt us, which wound your ſelves. Fatall Experience myght have taught you more diſcretion, then to be ſtill mouing that ſtone, which hath once crusht both your Church, &amp; ſtate to pieces.</p>
               <p>And truly the reproch of Anti-Chriſtian will fall on your Church, if proved againſt ours. For ſay what you pleaſe of the ancient Britans, the firſt Apoſtles of the Inglish who brought us the light of Faith, &amp; planted the Ghoſpel amongſt us, came from Rome. The Hierarchy you pretend to, came from thence: By authority from the Pope my Lord of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury is Primate, &amp; my Lord of London is his Suffragan. By the ſame authority the Country is divided into Dioceſes: your Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; Chapters ſetled: your univerſityes foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; ſeverall degrees inſtituted in them. If the Pope be <hi>the AntiChriſt,</hi> both univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitys,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102635:15"/>&amp; Hierarchy amongſt you is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>More over the Livings, you enjoy, were for the moſt part, if not altogether, given by the pious liberality of Perſons, who profeſt that Faith, we profeſſe, &amp; lived, &amp; dyed in the Communion of our Church. Gratitude to ſuch Benefactors may teach you to Judge leſſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely, to ſuſpend your Judgment, til you have more convincing arguments to ground it on, then your owne <hi>bare &amp; bold Aſſertion.</hi>

               <p> ANSWER. Are theſe the only, or even the Cheife <hi>Characters</hi> of Divine Truths, whither you take them, as they are delivered <hi>in holy writ,</hi> or as taught in the Church? Can you find no other quality peculiar to them, not common to others? Then humane learning may equall, if not ſurpaſſe Divine. Take, for example, ſome principles naturally knowne: as <hi>Two &amp; two make four:</hi> or, <hi>The whole body is greater then any part of it.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Tru:</hi> it is impoſſible they should be falſe. They are <hi>Perſpicuous,</hi> &amp; <hi>Eaſy:</hi> no man can doubt of them, who underſtands the termes. They are <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable:</hi> for what more reaſonable, then to aſſent to Evident Truth?

               <p>The reaſon of this ſtupendious blindneſſe in ſearching the ſcriptures, is that you reade

               </head>
               <p>G. B. Pag. 13. <hi>Scriptures being the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole counſell of God, &amp; written by plaine &amp; ſimple men, &amp; as firſt directed to the uſe of the rude illitterate vulgar, for teaching them the mysterye of Godlineſſe, &amp; the path of life, it is a shrewd indication, that if any ſtudy to kide this lyght under a candleſtick &amp; to keepe it in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, or forbid the body of Chriſtians the uſe of it, that thoſe muſt be conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of greate deformity to that rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Here you begin your charge of <hi>AntiChriſtianiſme</hi> againſt your mother-Church &amp; as the charge is falſe, ſoe in your managing it, you mingle many Errours, with ſome few truths. A bad cauſe is not capable of a better defence. I will take notice of ſome of your moſt conſiderable ſlips, &amp; leave the reader to Judge of the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Scriptures were written by plaine &amp; ſimple men,</hi> is not tru. Was Moſes ſuch, who was learned in all the learning of the Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians?
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102635:22"/>Was David the ſwette ſinger of Iſrael, <hi>a plaine &amp; ſimple man?</hi> What shall we ſay of Salomon, to whoſe wonderfull knowledge the Scripture it ſelfe beares witneſſe? <hi>Amos,</hi> it is true, was; but Eſayas was not, nor Daniel, nor Samuel. And who ever was Author of the Booke of Job, he was certainly far from being <hi>plaine &amp; ſimple:</hi> for in him are found in perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Phyloſophy, Aſtrology &amp; Divinity, as a queene gouverning them, &amp; if Cauſſinus the Jeſuit may be beleived, as compleate Rhetorick, as in any whoſoever. And as to the Authors of the new Teſtament, as long as S. Paul, S. Luke, &amp; S. John are amongſt them, you will never perſwade the learned part of the world, that your ſpeech is not rash &amp; inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe it tru, that they were all <hi>plaine &amp; ſimple men:</hi> what then? Doth it follow that what they writ, is eaſy to the meaneſt capacity? (for that you intend if you intend any thing.) Doe you not know, that theſe men, were only the Scribes, of the Holy Ghoſt? &amp; that in a ſcribe capacity of underſtanding is not neceſſary, but only fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in writing. No greate ſcience is neceſſary in a Printer who only Prints what is given him, by an Author: the Same of a Scribe, who writes what is dictated unto him. Now all Authors of Canonicall bookes are the Scribes of the Holy Ghoſt, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102635:22"/>is to be calculated according to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of that Divine Spirit; not of their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys. Take the moſt <hi>plaine, &amp; ſimple</hi> of them all,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

               <p>G. B. pag. 14. <hi>The hardeſts part of Scripture, are the writings of the old Teſtament, &amp; yet thoſe were communicated to all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Some parts, of the new are as hard, at any of the old, viz. the Apocalypſe, &amp; ſome parts of S. Paul's Epiſtle, <hi>are hard to be underſtood.</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="bottom">2. <hi>Pet</hi> 3.16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe, Is it not tru, that all the writings of the old Teſtament were made common to all the Iſraelits. <hi>The King</hi>
                  <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18.</note> was indeed <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write to himſelf a copy of the law out of that which was before the Preiſts the Levits.</hi> By which it appeares that even Copyes of the law were not ſoe ordinary. Which may be gatheted alſo out of the 4. of Kings c. 22. there was ſuch aſtonishment at the finding, &amp; reading of the booke of the law newly found in the Temple. The tencommand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were common, the Phariſys Phylac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryes prove it. As for the reſt, it was divided into <hi>Parashots,</hi> ſections, &amp; read unto the People, when they met on the Sabboth, as you may ſee, Acts 15.21. And in the ſecond
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102635:23"/>of Eſdras cap. 8. And the Same cuſtome is ſtill in the Cat. Church: which in her ſervice doth dayly reade ſome of the new, &amp; old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 14. <hi>What paynes are taken</hi> by Papiſts <hi>to detract from the Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures how they quarrel, its darkneſſe, its ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guousneſſe, the genuineſſe of its Originalls?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. This is a calumny. We all unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly owne Scripture to be the word of God: that no untruth can be found in it. Out of its <hi>darkneſſe, &amp; Ambiguity,</hi> we shew the neceſſity of receiving its ſenſe from Tradition; &amp; not ſticking to the bare letter of the Scripture without the ſenſe; which is to the letter, what a ſoul is to the body.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 15. <hi>We complaine of Scripture being too much peruſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Another calumny: In all our univerſitys we have <hi>maſters of Scriptures,</hi> who in thoſe, I know, take place of thoſe even of Divinity. Which shews the eſteeme we make of that ſtudy.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 15. <hi>Let as little of it be in vulgar tongues, as can be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Athird Calumny. It is all in Inglish, tranſlated by the Rhemish, &amp; Doway Colledges: &amp; in french, by the Doctors of Lovain. And as for the new teſtament, is it publisht in french by Rene Benoit, Brulot, Villcloin, &amp; Amelot. Beſides other editions
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102635:23"/>leſſe noted. And if there hath beene no new tranſlation into Inglish, it is not for any decrees forbidding it, but becauſe that firſt tranſlation is liked in groſſe, &amp; if any thing, be defective (as is unavoyable in all workes of men) it is not conſiderable, &amp; the like, or worſe, myght be feared in another.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 19. <hi>We reade it publickly in an unknowne tongue,</hi> in Latin.</p>
               <p>ANSWER. If this proves our diſlike of the Scriptures, it will likewiſe prove our diſlike of Councills &amp; Popes Bulls, (which you ſay we preferre before Scriptures) ſeing theſe were never extant in any vulgar language. <hi>Latin</hi> cannot truly abſolutely be called <hi>an unknowne tongue,</hi> in the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> ſeing it is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of her ſchooles, of her publiske ſervice, of her laws, of her Tribunalls, of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cills, &amp; in many places (as in Polony, &amp; hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher &amp; lower Germany) of almoſt every particular perſon, where very ordinarily even carters, &amp; watermen ſpeake it. And as for Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, &amp; Italians with little application, they underſtand it, by reaſon of the aſſinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their owne, &amp; the <hi>Latintongue.</hi> Soe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish cannot abſolutely beſayd to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue in <hi>Wales,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ireland,</hi> though in both there are ſeverall who underſtand it not.</p>
               <p>If this be not a ſufficient vindication of our Church, how will you excuſe your owne from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102635:24"/>the ſame fault, which never tranſlated the Scripture, into <hi>Irish,</hi> but uſes Inglish in Ireland even where there are many thouſands, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it as little, as Latin is underſtoode by any Catholick.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 15. <hi>We permit no private perſon the uſe of it, with out allowance from his Confeſſour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. A fourth Calumny. In Latin Greeke or Hebrew, it is univerſally permitted to all. In France no body ſcruples at the reading it in french, provided the Editions be approved. Your Brethren there could have informed you better: ſeeing they have had the confuſion to ſee their Miniſters mouths ſtopt, by Cutlers, &amp; Schoomakers out of their owne Bible: which could not be, had they not reade it.</p>
               <p>If the opinion of a <hi>Confeſſor</hi> be demanded, it is to know the Diſpoſition of the Perſon, who deſires it, whither it be ſuch, as good may behoped from that reading. All foode is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Almyghty God for the uſe of man. Yet without any injury to the Patient, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian may forbid him the uſe of ſome, which would nourish peccant humours. Soe <hi>Scripture</hi> are deſigned for our inſtruction unto Piety to God, &amp; Peace to our Neyghbours: If any mans mind be poſſeſt with opinions contrary to both, &amp; theſe opiniôns controuble all Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given him ſoe as all ſerve only to confirme him in his Impiety, &amp; turbulent humour,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102635:24"/>would you not adviſe him a diet, from ſuch ſtrong food, as Scripture? For example lately a greate part of the commonalty of our nation was ſo poſſeſt with a ſpirit of Rebellion againſt Eccleſiaſticall, &amp; Civill Government, that althô there be ſcarce any thing more recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Holy writ, then obedience to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, &amp; Prince, yet they thought the whole drift of Scripture abetted their Treaſon: not that any ſuch thing was to be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but that they fancyed it there, as men fancy, that the Bells ſpeake articulate words. In that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>juncture what advice would you give to an ignorant man, to be ſatisfyed with bookes of Devotion, &amp; Inſtructions drawne from Scripture which myght keepe him humble, &amp; Peaccable: or to continu reading the Scriptures which he thought preached ſedition, &amp; from which (throught his bad diſpoſition) he was confirmed in his Rebellions, &amp; AntiChriſtian Courſes.</p>
               <p>Another motive, why the Confeſſors advice is demanded, is that he myght inſtruct men how to reade, &amp; reape benefit from the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. To reade with the Humility of a Scholler, not the preſumption of a maſter, to make rather a Prayer, then a ſtudy, of it: To reſolve to practiſe what they underſtand: &amp; adore God for what they underſtand not. Soe that whither they doe, or doe not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, what they reade, they Glorify God in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102635:25"/>all, &amp; grow in vertu. After ſuch inſtructions applyed to the condition of every one, the benefit will be much greater, &amp; the danger of ill uſing it much diminished.</p>

                  <p> Theſe two Bookes are held to be <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> by Proteſtants, (of which I will not treate at preſent) yet why they should deny them credit in a matter offact, I know no reaſon. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they regard not what is reaſonable in their controverſys; but what ſerves their turne, I will shew the ſubſtance of all this, in bookes of unqueſtionable authority:<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Iſayas</hi> 44.17.</note> 
                     <hi>The reſidue of the Ash, be maketh a God he falleth downe unto it, &amp; adores it &amp; prayes unto it, &amp; ſayth, deliver me, for thou art my God</hi> The ſayings, of the other Bookes are only ampliations of this. Soe they cannot be denyed, without rejecting this; nor this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without retaining of thoſe.</p>
                  <p>A fifth reaſon is that the Idolaters were really perſwaded, that their Idols did helpethem. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Hier.</hi> 2.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Saying to a ſtocke thou art my father: &amp; to aſtone thou haſt begotten me.</hi> Certainly thoſe who could beleive that they ought their Being (the greateſt of all gifts) to their ſtatues, or Idols, of ſtone, or woode, would much eaſier believe they owed to them other goods of an inferiour nature. Certainly the Jews<note n="(c)" place="bottom">

But the moſt publick owning of ſingular benefits from Idols, is that of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits.<note n="(d)" place="bottom">

                  <p>If Mr. Still. think not this reaſon cleared enough out of Scripture, I shall deſire him to reade what is written by the Greekes of the Palladium of Troy; &amp; what the Romans thought of it, &amp; of their <hi>Ancilia,</hi> what Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blus writes of ſome Nations, who chained the Gods, Protectors of their Cittys, fearing they should forſake them. Let him at leaſt reade S. Auſtin l. 1. de Civit. c. 3. And if he be not convinced, that the Pagans had confidence in their ſtatues, or Idols, I ſay he shuts the eyes of his underſtanding ſoe cloſe, as to exclude al lyght, but what pleaſes him, &amp; ſerves his turne. Adde to his, Saint Cyprian l. ad Demetrianum. <hi>Pudeat te eos colere quos ipſe defendis, pudeat tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam de iis ſperare, quos tu ipſe tueris. Be ashamed to worship thoſe, whome you defend: &amp; to expect protection from thoſe, who themſelves neede yours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have two authorityes more, to confirme this reaſon: Jeremy<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Hier.</hi> 10.5.</note> affords the firſt. <hi>They muſt be carryed, becauſe they cannot goe. Wherefore Feare them not for they can nether doe hurt, nor good.</hi> To what intent could this reaſon be alleadged, unleſſe it were to confound that opinion that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102635:29"/>the ſtatues themſelves could helpe, or hinder? The Pagans then were poſſeſt with that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. My other is out of David<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.8. <hi>or Pſ.</hi> 115.8.</note> who having ſayd that the Idols of the Gentils were ſilver &amp; gold, the worke of mens hands: that they had eyes, &amp; could not ſee: eares, &amp; could not heare-&amp;c. He concludes his elegant induction, with theſe words: <hi>May every one who makes them be like unto them, &amp; alſo all who truſt in them.</hi> There was then a Truſt, a confidence, a relyance on thoſe Idols, which could not be grounded, but on an opinion that they did Good. Adde to this, what R. Majmonides ſays, as he is rendred by Dionyſius Voſſius, p. 8. <hi>Ab his ſimulacris bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na &amp; mala omnia provenire indicabant univerſis: &amp; proinde ſummo jure coli &amp; metui.</hi> And Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoras in his Embaſly for Chriſtians, p. 25. Ownes the ſame, but attributes the effects to ſpirits dwelling in them.</p>
                  <p>My laſt reaſon is taken from the ſeverall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments produced in ſcripture againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that they were made by men, that care muſt be taken they did not fall.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">ſupra.</note>

                  <p> You will ſay Pagans were wiſe men: how could they then be capable of ſoe groſſe an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? ANSWER. This is that weakeneſſe of the underſtanding incident to ſome: who in matters of fact require demonſtrations: ſoe a Philoſopher denyed locall Motion becauſe he could not anſwer the reaſons againſt it, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved no other confutation, but by this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Foole what doe I now.</hi> propoſed by a man who walked.

Yet amongſt all, me thinks, the cauſe of thoſe who adored the <hi>ſun</hi> was ſome what leſſe in excuſable then the reſt, for althô Reaſon teaches it evidently not to be a <hi>God,</hi> yet expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience shews it to have one <hi>Propertye of God,</hi> for the <hi>ſun</hi> gives lyght, &amp; life to all that have eye &amp; hart: it gives without intereſt: it never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, but as a common good, &amp; beſides its viſible effects, produces many other by hidden influences. Theſe conſiderations doe not excuſe, but they ſomewhat diminish the guilt of

                  <p>To ſumme up what we have ſayd: we find that even the wiſeſt men have beene guilty of the greateſt folly, that can enter into any man's head, how weake ſoever, to take for a God, a thing ſoe much inferiour to them in nature. That they expected helpe of a thing helpeleſſe, &amp; direction from what is ſenteleſſe. To this they were diſpoſed by the humane shape, ſtriking their fancy; they were moved to it by <hi>love</hi> of a dead maſter, <hi>feare</hi> of a living Tyrant, <hi>flattery</hi> to one, on whome their fortune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended: &amp; theſe altogether heygthned by the <hi>Illuſion of the Divill.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Gratitude</hi> to beneficiall creatures, enclined men to renounce the greate Benefactor. Yet theſe motives how powerfull ſoever, could never have made men ſoe prodigiouſly to renounce the uſe of Reaſon, had they not, by former ſins, ſoe far left God, as to deſerve to beleft by him: not that they received no grace at all from him; but that they had not ſuch graces as would keepe them in what was good, &amp; prevent their fall, into thoſe ſenſeleſſe errors.</p>

                  <p>THe occaſion I have, to treate this queſtion is given by G.B. &amp; E. Still. who pretent that Cheifely one &amp; he <hi>the tru God</hi> was adore by the <hi>Idolaters,</hi> who uſed ſeverall Statues, &amp; names only to repreſent his ſeverall attributes. And that by <hi>Iupiter</hi> they underſtood the <hi>in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What I have cited out of ſcripture, &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is ſufficient to convince the contrary ſeing by that it appeares that dead men, Stars &amp;c. were adored. Voſſius l. 1. de Idol. cap. 5 p. 30. ſays, Idolatry began with the adoration of Angels, thence paſt to the ſouls of men Lactantius l. 2. c. 14. ſays, the Aegyptians firſt adored the Stars, afterwards their Kings. S. Cyril of Alex. l. 1. cont. Jul. p. 17. ſayth the ſame of the Chaldaeans. But the Aegyptians, whileſt the Iſraelits lived amongſt them adored ether <hi>Apis</hi> or <hi>Ioſeph</hi> under the shape of an oxe, or calfe. And in imitation of them the Iſraelits
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102635:36"/>in the deſert, Exod. 32. &amp; the ten Tribes at their ſchiſme from the Temple of Hieruſalem, the third of Kings 12.28. which continued amongſt them, till they were removed quite out of the country. Althô that was not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Idolatry, they were guilly of: for they had <hi>Baal,</hi> 3. Reg. 18. <hi>&amp; the hoſt of Heaven</hi> toward the end, of their kingdome as appeares 4. Reg. 17.16. which they learnt probably of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians. After the tranſmigration of the Tribe of Juda, we find thoſe who remaind in their country much addicted the to the Star worship, Hieremy 44. as to a ſuperſtition ancient amongſt them: which I gueſſe they learnt of their King Achaz, &amp; that he received it from Damaſcus. 4. Reg. 16. where a copy of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar was ſent to the hygh Preiſt to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made like it, &amp; placed in the Temple. But this being a matter of no moment, I doe not trouble myſelfe with further examining it. Our only diſpute is about the Romans, &amp; Greekes: whoſe Idolatry was banisht the world by Chriſtian Religion, which our moderne adverſarys pretend that we have renewed againe.</p>
                  <p>You ſay the, that they, by <hi>Iupiter,</hi> adored <hi>thetru God Creator of Heaven &amp; Earth:</hi> we ſay, that all the Gods of the Pagans, were men, &amp; that <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelf was ſuch. And that they were Divills who tooke uppon themſelves thoſe perſons names, to delude the word. I will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102635:37"/>prove this 1.<hi rend="sup">ò</hi> out of Scripture, 2.<hi rend="sup">ò</hi> out of ſuch fathers as lived with the Pagans &amp; conſequently had more occaſion to know their Theology then we, who muſt gather it only out of their writings 3.<hi rend="sup">ò</hi> out of the Confeſſion of Pagans, 4.<hi rend="sup">ò</hi> out of the acknowledgment of the Gods themſelves, who were adored, &amp; laſtly by the Confeſſion of Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>My firſt proofe is taken out of Scripture, pſal. 95. (96) 5. <hi>All the Gods of the nations are Divills. Omnes Dil gentium Daemonia.</hi> Soe it is in the vulgate Edition, &amp; was ſoe from the beginning, while Paganiſme flourisht: &amp; yet Pagans never accuſed the Chriſtians for impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing uppon them opinions, which they did not hold. See S. Aug. uppon that place. The Inglish tranſlation is ſome what different. viz. <hi>All the Gods of the nations are Idols.</hi> Which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twithſtanding confutes ſufficiently the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary error: for if this be tru: <hi>All Gods of nations are Idols,</hi> as it muſt, being in Scripture: E. S. his propoſition being contradictory to it, muſt be falſe, <hi>Iupiter, the cheife God nations, is no Idol, nor Divil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover if the ſacrifice the Idolaters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, (which was always held to be the Prime act of Religion) was offred by them to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, &amp; not to God, then it follows they did not worship the tru God but only Divills. But they ſacrificed to Divills, &amp; not to God, Ergo they did not adore the tru God; but Divills.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102635:37"/>I prove the minor: Deuter. 32.17. <hi>They ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Divills; not to God: to Gods whome they knew not, to new Gods, who came newly up, whome your fathers feared not.</hi> Pſal. 105. (106.) 37. <hi>They ſacrificed their ſons, &amp; their daughters unto Divills.</hi> And 1. Cor. 10.20. <hi>The things which the Gentills ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to Divills, &amp; not to God.</hi> Hence Aug l. 20. cont. Fauſt. c. 18. ait: <hi>Nihil in ſacrificiis Paganorum Deo diſplicuiſſe, niſi quod fierent daemoniis. Nothing in ſacrifices of the Pagans was diſpleaſing to God, but thoſe to whome they were offred.</hi> viz, the Divils.</p>
                  <p>My ſecond proofe is taken out of thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who living with theh Pagans, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing familiarly with their perſons, (ſome of them having bin Pagans themſelves) &amp; writing againſt them, had moſt reaſon to know their ſentiments concerning their Gods: &amp; durſt not miſrepreſent them, for <hi>Feare of God,</hi> who forbids lying, <hi>&amp; shame of men,</hi> who would have diſcovered their fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

                  <p>Alexander in a particular booke ſent to his mother, acquaints her, that he by threates had forced out of an Aegyptian Preiſt, this ſecret, that all the Gods (which he with the reſt of the Pagans adored) had beene men. This is cited by Athenagoras pag. 31. S. Cyp. l. de Idol. vanit. &amp; S. Auſtin lib. 8. de Civit. Deic. 27. who names the Preiſt, revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of this ſecret, <hi>Leo.</hi>

                  <p>Againe Gal. 4.8. the Galatians <hi>knowing not God, ſerved thoſe who by nature were not Gods.</hi> Which are the words of the Apoſtle. And E.S. ſays: <hi>The Galatians knew Iupiter, &amp; ſerved him, who was the tru God.</hi> Wherein he directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The like arguments myght be brought from the authoritys cited out of Fathers, Proteſtants, &amp; Pagans; who aſſuring univerſally, that all the Pagan Deityes were rayſed from men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all poſſibility of <hi>Iupiter's</hi> being otherwiſe, he being one of them. Indeed no body ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the Catholick Roman Church, that it did not adore the tru God, althô many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102635:45"/>the adoration of the Saints, to be like to that of the Pagan <hi>Idolaters</hi> adoring of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundary Gods: why then should the <hi>Pagans</hi> be abſolutely ſayd not to adore <hi>the tru God,</hi> if they did adore him, althô they joined others in alike degree of worship with him? But ſeing E. S. &amp; G.B. pretend <hi>Iupiter</hi> to be the name of <hi>the tru God Bleſſed for ever more,</hi> amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, I will shew, that <hi>Iupiter,</hi> according to Fathers, Poets, &amp; Proteſtants, was a man, as well as the reſt: &amp; I will confirme all with E.S. his owne teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>My next proofe is taken from thoſe, who confound <hi>iupiter</hi> with the reſt of the Gods, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, Neptune, Pluto, &amp;c.</hi> as well as of the other Gods. We have heard <hi>Tertullian</hi> aſſure, that <hi>Saturne</hi> was the ancienteſt of their Gods: &amp; that the reſt ought their being to him, &amp; thence inferred, that he being a man, all the reſt muſt have beeneſoe too. See alſo Lactan. Firm. who ſays l. 1. c. 15. <hi>It is evident all the gods were men,</hi> See Tertul. c. 10. p. 39. His words are cited above ſec. 3. note that Voſſiusl. 1. Idol. c. 18 p. 139 thinks this an invincible argument, to prove that by <hi>Saturne</hi> the Pagans underſtond <hi>Adam.</hi> Now if Saturne was the ancienteſt of all the Pagans Gods, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who is on of them, is not <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> eternall: &amp; conſequently not <hi>the tru God.</hi> See Minutius Felix p 23. where <hi>Iupiter</hi> is ſayd to be caſt out of poſſeſt body, as well as <hi>Saturne,</hi> &amp; <hi>Serapis:</hi> as having nothing
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102635:45"/>peculiar above the reſt. W.L. indeed puts an emphaſis uppon his name, <hi>Iupiter himſelfe,</hi> when he tranſlates thoſe words: which is not in the Authour, at leaſt as we have him: which shews only, that the Pagans had a greater veneration for Jupiter then for the reſt: yet without taking him out of the number of thoſe <hi>Heathen Gods,</hi> who were ſubject to <hi>Christians exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſmes.</hi>

Then which, what can be more abſurd? Seing Iupiter is not worshipt without the partnership of his wife, &amp; daughter.

                  <p>He may learne thirdly, that not only the leſſer Gods; but even Iupiter himſelf was ſubject to the whips, &amp; torments inflicted byour exorciſts.</p>
                  <p>My ſixth proofe is drawne from the opinion of the Pagans. See <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> l. 2. mithol. c. 1. &amp; ſequent: Where you find many cited. Lucian <hi>in Iove Tragaedo,</hi> ſays that <hi>Damis</hi> an Atheiſt, having objected to one, who defended
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102635:47"/>the Divinity of the Gods, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> the cheife of them was dead, as alſo his ſepulcher, which was extant, &amp; a Pillerneere it, teſtifying the truth of that death: <hi>Iupiter</hi> he ſays, grew Pale, &amp; diſmayed hearing it, being conſcious of the truth, &amp; that truth tended to roote up the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his <hi>Divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My ſeventh proofe is grounded on what the Fathers write of him, viz 1. <hi rend="sup">ò</hi> that he was not a God. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi> But that he was a man. 3. <hi rend="sup">ò</hi> That we as a wicked man, ſubject to ſuch vices, as would make any civill man blush. Juſtinus M. Paraen. pag. 2. shews him to have bewayled like a woman the death of <hi>Sarpedon.</hi> His inſatiable luſt both after women, &amp; boys is noted by all: ſo is his Ambition, which shewed it ſelfe by his Rebellion againſt his owne Father. Now how can the Fathers be excuſed from horrible Blaſphemy, in accuſing the Pagan <hi>Iupiter</hi> of theſe crimes, if he be <hi>the tru God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conclude this proofe with an invincible reaſon taken from S. Auſtin l. 1. de conſenſu Evangeliſtarum, c. 26. None of all the Gods, adored <hi>by Pagans,</hi> oppoſed the adoration of any other. <hi>Diana,</hi> &amp; <hi>Minerva</hi> never expreſt any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of men adoring of <hi>Venus</hi> &amp; <hi>Priapus, Saturne</hi> was willing his rebellious ſon <hi>Iupiter</hi> should be adored: <hi>Vulcan</hi> very quietly endured the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Venus</hi> his wanton Wiſe, &amp; of <hi>Mars,</hi> whome he had found <hi>in flagranti</hi> with her. And <hi>Iupiter</hi> never checked his daughter <hi>Venus,</hi> for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102635:48"/>thoſe filthy faults, which would have made her unfit company for civill men, or women. Whence the ſaint concludes them all, &amp; <hi>Iupitu</hi> too, to have beene Divels, who aimed only at the courruption of manners. This be confirmes, from the law of <hi>the tru</hi> &amp; <hi>living God,</hi> who for bad them all to be adored, commanded all their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to be pulled downe, all their rites, &amp; cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes, &amp; ſacrifices to be abolished. By which <hi>Satis oſtendit illos falſos, atque fallaces, &amp; ſe eſſe verum ac verace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deums</hi> he convinces ſufficiently that falſe opinion newly broached by E. S.</p>
                  <p>My laſt proofe is taken from the teſtimony of learned Proteſtants, who all acknowledged this truth, till the deſire of accuſing Popery engaged E. S. in the contrary opinion. We have ſeene W.L. naming <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelf God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win l. 4. Antiquitat. c. 2. ſays that <hi>Iupiter &amp; Baal ſemen,</hi> which ſignifyes <hi>the Lored</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> is one &amp; the ſame thing, viz, the ſun: as the <hi>Queene</hi> or <hi>lady</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> is the Moone. Voſſius is of the ſame opinion with us, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> was a man.

                  <p>OUr diſpute here is not of the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp; planters of <hi>Idolatry;</hi> but of thoſe who lived at &amp; ſince the time of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> till <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> prevayled.</p>
                  <p>I doe not doubt at all, but God, when he created Man, endowed him with all knowledge neceſſary, for the end, fot which he created him: &amp; certainly that of his Creator was as neceſſary, as any, ſeing uppon it was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his obligation to ſerve God, by fullfilling his Will, &amp; obeying his commands.</p>
                  <p>It is, I think no leſſe certain, that all, &amp; every ſoul, at its creation, receives an <hi>Idea</hi> of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:102635:53"/>God &amp; that ſo deepely imprinted in it, that no ignorance, no want of education, no bad inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction, can weare it out, or entirely deface it. Hence it is, that altnô ſeverall barbarous nations adore as Gods, things, which are not God, (as hath been e ſeene of the <hi>Pagans</hi>) yet there never were any without ſome object of Adoration, which they thought to be <hi>God.</hi> Yet Reaſon left to its ſelfe &amp; taking the freedome of diſcourſe about it, will cover it with Errors, which may darken its lineaments, without deſtroying it; as Rubbidge throwne on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Statu, will bide its beaty from the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator's eye althô it nether alters the ſituation of its parts, nor deſtroys their proportion. One greate advantage, we have by <hi>Faith,</hi> is that it fixeth in our ſouls a ryght Idea of God, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes thoſe imaginations, which are inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it. The whole created world is left to the diſputations of men's barts (Eccleſ. 3.11.) for the exerciſe of their intellectualls: in which they are often miſtaken (for they <hi>shall not find out the work, that God maketh from the beginning to theend</hi>) yet their errours are without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the maine chance, their ſalvation, as long as they containe themſelves within their bounds, nor endeavour to know more of God, them they should, or have learnr of him, nor labour to meſure <hi>Immenſity</hi> with a <hi>ſpan.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by lamentable experience they will find the truth of thoſe words: <hi>Scrutator Majeſtatis
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102635:53"/>opprimetur à gloria.</hi> Of which we have as many examples, as Philoſophers, who attempted it. The wiſeſt of them all in this, was <hi>Simonides,</hi> who ſayd ingenuouſly to <hi>Hiero,</hi> that the more he ſtudyed it, the leſſe he underſtood of it. Hence S. Auſtin l. 8. de Trinit. c. 2. having ſavd, that <hi>God is Truth,</hi> gives us a warning to ſticke in the thought of that terme: <hi>Noli quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere quidſit veritas, ſtatim enim ſe oppoent cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines imaginum corporalium, &amp; nubila phantaſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; pertubabunt ſerenitatem, quae primo ictu quo velut coruſcatione perſtringeris, cùm dicitur veritas, mane ſi potes, ſed non potes. Relaberis in iſtaſolita atque terrena. When I ſay, Truth, examin not what it is I meane, otherwiſe miſts of Phancys &amp; cloud of corporeall Images will interpoſe, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave you of the lyght which appeared at firſt: ſtop, if poſſible in the firſt limpſe of the lyght: but you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe it, for you will always ſlide into other thoughts.</hi> And in the following chapter he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes in alike manner of the thought of <hi>Good: Bonum hoc, &amp; bonum illud. Tolle hoc &amp; illud, &amp; vide ipſum bonum, ſi potes, ita Deum videbis, non alio bono bonum; ſed bonum omnis boni. Speake not of this good, or that good: take away this, &amp; that, &amp; ſee, if poſſible, goodneſſe it ſelfe &amp; you will ſee God, not good by any other goodneſſe diſtinct from him; but the goodneſſe of all good things.</hi> Thus whither we conceive God, <hi>as the prime Truth,</hi> or as <hi>the ſoveraigne good,</hi> our <hi>firſt Thoughts are</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:102635:54"/>Orthodox; as coming from God the Auth or of nature, &amp; our miſery proceedes from our not ſtopping in them.</p>
                  <p>This was the reaſon, why Tertullian l. de Teſtim. animae c. 1. being deſirous to shew, for the confuſion of Pagans, that naturall Image of <hi>one God,</hi> which all ſouls ever had, examins only ſuch a ſoul, as retaines its native ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, without any adſcititious knowledge. <hi>Non eam te advoco,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>quae ſcholis formata, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliothecis exercitata, academicis &amp; porticibus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam ſapientiam ructas. Te ſimplicem, &amp; rudem, &amp; impolitam, &amp; idioticam compello, qualem habent, qui te ſolam habent illam impſam de compito, &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio, de textrino totam. Imperitiâ tuâ mihi opus est, quoniam aliquantulae peritiae tuae nemo credit. Ea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulo, quae tecum in hominem infers, quae aut ex temetipsâ, aut ex quocunque authore tuo didiciſti, I would not have thee o ſoul, framed in ſchooles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in librarys, filled, with the learning of Platonicks, or Stoicks. I deſire thee rude, ſimple, impolisht, &amp; an idiot. Such as thou art in the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, &amp; meaneſt Artiſam. I have neede of thy Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for thy learning is ſuſpected. I would know what ſentiment thou broughteſt with thee into thy body, whither thou hadſt it of thy ſelfe, or receivedſt it of thy Creator.</hi> He ſays, the ſame in ſubſtance in his Apologetick cap. 17. p. 43. &amp; 48. only he extends this teſtimony of the unlearned, to the learned ſoul, in ſuddain occurrences, when acquired learning is uſeleſſe, &amp; nature alone
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102635:54"/>worketh. And he gives another reaſon, why our underſtanding retaines not as it should do, the firſt Idea of God: the greateneſſe of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſurpaſſing its capacity. <hi>Deum vis magnitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis &amp; notum hominibus, objecit, &amp; ignotum.</hi> Which you may find likewiſe in S. Cyp. de Idol. van. p. 206</p>
                  <p>Out of what I have ſayd, you may ſee, that our queſtion is not whither we have all a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion of <hi>one God?</hi> But whither the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the <hi>Pagans</hi> did teach, that there was but <hi>one God?</hi> or whither the unity of God was a principle of their Religion, &amp; an article of their <hi>Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Anſwer to this queſtion; is <hi>negative:</hi> ſo that we ſay, <hi>Politheiſme</hi> was an eſſentiall point of <hi>Paganiſme:</hi> &amp; one maine queſtion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated betwint <hi>Chriſtians</hi> &amp; <hi>Pagans,</hi> was whither there was only one God? This I gather firſt out of Scripture: Pſal. 75. (or 76.) <hi>Notus in Iudaeâ Deus, &amp; in Iſrael magnum nomen ejus. In Iudah God is knowne, &amp; his name is greate in Iſrael.</hi> As if out of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> he had not beene knowne. S. Hierome ſays that is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>before the Croſſe of Chriſt had enlyght ned the world. Antequam illuminaret Crux mundum, &amp; antequam viderctur Dominus in terrâ, quando au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem venit Salvator in omnem terram exivit ſonus eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> But <hi>when our B. Saviour came the name of God was ſpreade to the extremity's of the earth,</hi> amongſt the beleivers or Chriſtians.</p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:102635:55"/>
                  <p> And S. Auſtin: <hi>Solent inimici Domini Ieſu-Chriſti omnibus noti Iudaei gloriari in iſto Pſalmo, quem cantavimus, dicentes: Notus in Iudaeâ Deus: &amp; inſult are gentibus quibus non eſt notus Deus, &amp; dicere, quia ſibi ſolis not us eſt Deus, alibi ergò ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notus. Not us eſt autem revera in Iudaeâ Deus, ſi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligant quid ſit Iudaea. Name verè non eſt notus Deus, niſi in Iudaeâ. Ecce &amp; nos hoc dicimus. The knowne ennemys of our Lord Ieſus-Chriſtus, glory in this Pſalme &amp; inſult over the Gentils, ſaying that God is knowne to them,</hi> the Jews, <hi>wherefore he muſt be unknowne to the Nations. Now we grant, that God is knowne only to Iews, or in Iewry,</hi> &amp; then he shews that the Chriſtians circunciſion ofthe hart, &amp; ſpirit (of which Rom. 2.29.) doth entirle them to the knowledge of God, reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Pſalme <hi>to Iuda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, out of Teſtimony of the Pagan Gods taken out of S. Cyril of Alex. lib. 5. contra Julianum, pag. 180. where he ſays: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The doctrine of the Hebrews is confirmed by the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of Iulian's Gods,</hi> Apollo <hi>being conſulted, what nations were the Wiſeſt? The Oracle anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: The Chaldaeans, for Philoſophy, or naturall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:102635:55"/>learning, but the Iews (who adore only one God, &amp; King) for Divinity.</hi> As the Poliglot paraphraſes the oracles ſenſe, prolog. 12. pag. 82. This oracle is alſo cited by Juſtinus M. Paraen. p. 23. &amp; Theodoret l. 1. de curan. Graec. Affect. pag. 472. where he brings <hi>Porphyrius</hi> owning the Oracle.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly out of Fathers. We cannot deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>better witneſſe of the ſentiments, of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> &amp; the point diſputed betwint them, &amp; <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> them <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who very probably had beene one himſelf, at leaſt had converſt with their perſons, &amp; writings, what I cite here out of him is the more to be valued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe S. Cyprian uſes the ſame argument, lib. de Idol. vanit. pag. 207. Now Tertullian lib. de teſtimonio animae c. 2. <hi>Non placemus, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num praedicantes hoc nomine unico unicum, à quo omnia, &amp; ſub quo univerſa. Dic teſtimonium ſi ita ſcis. Nam te quoque palam, &amp; totâ libertate, quâ non licet nobis, domi ac foris audimus it a pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciare, quod Deus dederit, &amp; ſi Deus voluerit: eâ voce, &amp; aliqueme eſſe ſignificas, &amp; omnem illi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteris poteſtatem, ad cujus ſpectas voluntatem, ſimul &amp; coeteros negas Deos eſſe, dum ſuis vocabulis nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupas Saturnum, Iovem. Nam ſolùm Deum confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, quem tantùm Deum nominas, ut &amp; cùm illos interdum Deos appellas, &amp; alieno &amp; quaſi pro mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo uſu videaris. The Pagans are diſpleaſed with us, when we preach one Lord, from whome are all things, to whome all are ſubject, Speake oſoul, what
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102635:56"/>thou knoweſt of this: Speake boldy with that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is granted to thee though denyed to us.</hi> Thou ſayſt. <hi>God grant it, if it pleaſe God: by which words thou expreſſeſt ſome one, &amp; acknowledgeſt, that he hath all prower, &amp; denyes thoſe to be Gods, whome thou deſigneſt by their names: Saturne, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Mars, &amp;c. For thou profeſſeſt to beleive one, whome thou calleſt God, of thy ſelfe; &amp; when thou giveſt that name to others, thou uſeſt borrowed notions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe Apolog. 17. pag. 47. <hi>Quod colimus, Deus unus eſt.</hi> This is the Chriſtians poſition againſt <hi>Pagans, Weadore only one God.</hi> And. p. 48. <hi>Vultis ex operibus ipſius, vultis ex animae ipſius te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonio, comprobemus: quae licet carcere corporis preſſa, licet inſtitutionibus pravis circumſcripta, licet libidinibus &amp; concupiſcentiis evigorata, licet Diis falſis exancillata, cùm tamen reſipiſcit, ut ex crapulâ, ut ex ſomno, ut ex aliquâ valetudine, &amp; ſanitatem ſuam patitur, Deum nominat hoc ſolo, quiapropriè verus hic unus, Deus honus &amp; magnus. Et quod Deus dederit. Iudicem quoque illum conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatur, Deus videt, Deo commendo, &amp; Deus mihi reddet. Shall I prove this one God out of his workes, or our of the teſtimony of man's ſouls? which altho it be shut up in the priſon of the body, ſpoiled by bad inſtructions, weakened by concupiſcence, &amp; enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to falſe Gods, yet if she come, toher ſelfe, shee profeſſes, one God, greate, &amp; good, she calls his to witneſſe, ſaying God knows. I leave it to God.</hi> Then Tertullian concludes with this exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102635:56"/>
                     <hi>O teſtimonium animae naturaliter Chriſtianae! O teſtimony of a ſoul, which is Chriſtian by nature!</hi> Now I deſire to know of E. S. how he could inferre the ſoul naturally to be Chriſtian, becauſe naturally it owned <hi>one only God,</hi> if this were not the maine point controverted? will he ſay, I am a Proteſtant becauſe I profeſſe to beleive in <hi>one God,</hi> as Proteſtants doe? or shall I ever think E. S. a Papiſt, forſaying he <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves in Chriſt.</hi> No certainly, thoſe being points in which both partyes agree. <hi>Tertullian's</hi> greate wit could never be ſo eaſily ſuprized with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of a <hi>Proſelit,</hi> if what E. S. ſays be tru, that both contending partyes agreed in profeſſing <hi>one God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame reaſon myght be brought out of Minutius Felix, who ſays pag 14. <hi>Audio vulgus cùm ad coelum manus tendunt, nihil aliud quàm Deum dicunt: &amp; Deus magnus eſt.

I heare the people call uppon God.</hi> (naming only one) <hi>Are theſe words the ſpeech of Pagan, or the confeſſion of faith of a Christian?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here me thinks, I ſee E. S. triumphing, as finding what deſtroys my concluſion, in the forgoing words: which shew that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beleived <hi>one God.</hi> But I anſwer, that all <hi>exprest that beleife int heir indeliberate Actions, &amp; deliberately acted contrary:</hi> &amp; for that reaſon were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> condemned by their owne judgment. Let us heare Tertullian l. de teſtim.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102635:57"/>animae c. 6. p. 126. <hi>Meritò igitur omnis anima rea &amp; teſtis eſt, in tantùm rea erroris, in quantùm teſtis veritatis: &amp; ſtabit ante aulas Dei in die ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicii, nihil habens dicere.

                  <p>Commonly the Fathers labour to prove the unity of <hi>a God,</hi> againſt the Pagans. So doth Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus M. Athenagoras, Minut. Felix, S.

Celſ. p. 5. reduces the diſputes againſt Paga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to two heades: <hi>Idols,</hi> &amp; <hi>Politheiſme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I end with Lactantius Firmianus l. 1. divin. inſtit. c. 1. pag 8. ſays to <hi>Conſtantin</hi> the Greate: <hi>Tu primus Romanorum Principum, repudiatis er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roribus majeſtatem Dei ſingularis ac veri &amp; cegno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſti,

                  <p>Yet I deſire E.

                  <p>There occurres to me only one tolerable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt what I here aſſert: viz, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Manichaean</hi> reproches to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they teceived the <hi>Opinion of Monarchy,</hi> (that is the Beleife of one God) from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:</hi> whence it follows, that the <hi>Pagans</hi> beleived but one God. To which I anſwer 1. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine we received that dogme not from <hi>Pagans;</hi> but from God: So <hi>Fauſtus</hi> is moſt certainly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in that. And why may we not ſuſpect his teſtimony as to the other part, of the opinion of <hi>Pagans,</hi> concerning one God? I anſwer 2. with S. Auſtin l. 20. contra Fauſt. c. 19. that the Pagans were not to ſuch a degree blinded with their falſe Gods, &amp; tru Devils Arts, as to have entirely loſt the Image of <hi>one tru God</hi> received at their creation: though for their Ingratitude to their <hi>Creator,</hi> they were permitted to fall to the Adoration of the <hi>Creature, Idols,</hi> &amp; <hi>Devils.</hi> Thus

                  <p>THe greateſt difficulty (againſt what I have ſayd ſect. 4. about the <hi>Pagan Iupiter,</hi> not being the tru God, but firſt a man, &amp; then a Divel) is taken from Act. 17.23. <hi>I found an Altar,</hi> ſays the B. Apoſtle, <hi>with this inſcription: TO THE VNKNOWNE GOD. whome therefore yet ignorantly worship, him I declare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> This E. S. pretends to be meant of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp; confirmes it very artificially, out of <hi>Aratus,</hi> out of whome <hi>S. Paul</hi> cites ſome peieos of verſes. And S. Paul ſaying he preacht him, it will follow, that he preacht <hi>Iupiter,</hi> &amp; ſo <hi>Iupiter</hi> muſt be a name of the <hi>tru God:</hi> for certainly S. Paul never preacht any other. Thus E. S. p. 7.</p>
                  <p>How his learned adverſary T. G. hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged this debated point, I cannot tell: but doubtleſſe his workes, if I had them, would
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102635:59"/>give me greate lyght. And what I ſay, I shall willingly reforme according to his, in caſe it be materially different.</p>
                  <p>I think it certaine, that <hi>the unknowne God,</hi> was not <hi>Iupiter.</hi> To prove this, I may bring all thoſe Authors <hi>Pagans</hi> &amp; <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who ſpeake of the occaſion of dedicating this Altar. Againe <hi>Iupiter</hi> could not be ſayd, to be <hi>an unknowne God in Athens;</hi> for they knew his country, his birth, his life, &amp; death, his ſepulcher, his geſts, his parents, &amp;c. Their Theaters, their Tribunalls, their Temples, didring with his name. Thirdly they had Altars erected to his honour, in their <hi>Forum,</hi> their Corners-of-Streetes, &amp; even in their private houſes; whereas there was only one Altar erected to this <hi>unknowne God.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had S. Paul declared <hi>Iupiter</hi> to them, he would at leaſt <hi>en paſſant,</hi> have rejected thoſe abſurd fables, which were told of him: of his birth, &amp; death, of his Rebellion, &amp; filthy luſt, &amp;c. (which are much more unbeſeeming a god, as being more dangerous to morality then the things the Apoſtle ſpeakes of.) At which the Apoſtle doth not hint in the leaſt manner.</p>
                  <p>Hence it followeth, that S. Paul did not preach <hi>Iupiter.</hi> This is evident out of what I have ſayd, &amp; the Apoſtles words: <hi>Quem ignorantes colitis, hunc ego annuncio: Whome you ignorantly worship, him I declare.</hi> Soc that he ſpeakes cleerely of the <hi>unknowne God,</hi> who was not <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What shall we then ſay to <hi>Aratus,</hi> who
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102635:60"/>cleerely ſpeakes of <hi>Iuptier.</hi> ANSWER. What he ſayd of god, was tru, &amp; conformable to that <hi>naturall Idaea,</hi> which, as is aboveſayd, we all have of <hi>God;</hi> but he erroneouſly applyed to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the <hi>Arch-Divel.</hi> Now S. Paultakes his thoughts which were tru, &amp; applyes them to that <hi>ſelf exiſtent Being,</hi> to whome alone they belong: as if a crowne by Rebells ſet uppon a ſubjects head, should be taken off it, &amp; ſet on the Kings, to whome of ryght it belongs.</p>
                  <p>Where, by the by, we may take notice of a groſſe errour of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who ſays it is as good to have no thought at all, as an erroneous one, of God: <hi>Quid intereſt Deum neges, an infames?</hi> God out of his goodneſſe to man hath given him that Idea, of himſelfe, which being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, althô defaced with errours, yet will helpe to correct then when we make aryght uſe of our reaſon. As the ſtatue (of which I ſpoke in the fifth Sect.) Layd in the dirt, may be taken up, brusht &amp; washt, ſoe as to be reſtored to its: firſt beauty. Thus S. Auſtin convinced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the <hi>Manichaean haereſy</hi> could not be tru. Thus the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> ſaw the falshood of their <hi>Pagan Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I pray God many others, who at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hold errours in Religion, may ſo uſe their Reaſon, as to overcome them.</p>

               <p>G. B. pag. 17. <hi>Our kindneſſe to the ſecond Commandment appeares by our having ſtriken it out of our Catechiſmes.</hi>

               <p>ANS. You myght for this reaſon accuſe our B. Saviour of the like kindneſſe: who Mat. 19.18.19. left it out of that Compendium of the Commandments. And Luke 10.27. he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves an abridgement made by another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that part.</p>

               <p>ANS. I acknowledge my ignorance in this. Shew me, that ever any ſuch vertu was affixt, <hi>to ſun, or ſtars, or Ancilia, or Palladia.</hi> And Act. 19.35. which you cite, there is nomore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, then of the day of your birth, or of Tom Thomb.</p>

               <p>ANS. It shews, they adored that Idol: or if you pleaſe, An <hi>oxe eating hay,</hi> as the place ſays, which you cite. And doe you think ſuch a <hi>beaſt</hi> to be <hi>the tru God?</hi> I am ashamed to anſwer ſuch ridiculous diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>G. B. pag. 22. <hi>The worship of the maſſe is Idolatry, as evidently as any piece of Gentiliſme ever was.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. When you shall have shewed, that Chriſt is not really preſent, or that althô pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he deſerves not to be adored, we will ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend our Adoration of him there. But you will prove nether, as long, as his words remaines. Soe our Adoration of him preſent there, is like to continu.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 23. <hi>The worship we give to the Croſſe, is an Adoring, of God under a Symbol, &amp; Repreſentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. It is a worshipping of God: &amp; ſoe no Idolatry. It is a repreſentation of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, &amp; worshipt only as ſuch.</p>

               <p>G. B. Pag. 24. <hi>Concerning theſe</hi> (the ſouls of deceaſed men) <hi>the Heathens belevied that they were certain intermediall powers, that went betwixt God, &amp; men: by whome alſo all our ſervices were offred to the Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. We have here many errours in few words. The firſt is, that the ſouls of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed men were univerſally by all Pagans thought to act any thing in this world. In <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, Lucian,</hi> &amp; others, you may ſee, that many (thoſe of wicked men) only ſuffred, being conceived to be puniſhed for their faults. Nay out of the ſame Authours it is probable, that even the better, more innocent, &amp; therefore eſteemed happy ſouls, tooke their pleaſure in the <hi>Eliſian feilds,</hi> without troubling themſelves with things of this world. This is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the Pythagorean doctrine of the tranſmigration of ſouls from one body to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102635:64"/>which was very common amongſt the Pagan learned Phyloſophers. None of theſe, could beleive that <hi>the ſouls of Deceaſed men could be mediating ſpirits,</hi> which you aſcribe to all <hi>Pagans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that <hi>Deceaſed men</hi> even when deifyed, were by all held to be <hi>mediating powers.</hi> I have shewed at large above, that the <hi>Prime Gods</hi> had beene <hi>men:</hi> &amp; that the <hi>Iupiter</hi> had beene one: I deſire you to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the grounds I have layd for this Aſſertion: for which ſee alſo <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> pag. 4. <hi>Romulus</hi> was a man, the founder &amp; firſt King of Rome, (I hope you doe not expect I ſhould prove this) yet he had a <hi>Flamen</hi> conſecrated to his ſervice: which was <hi>an officer peculiar to the ſupreme God,</hi> ſays E. S. p. 34. &amp; conſequently was thought to be <hi>him,</hi> or was ranked with <hi>him.</hi> Indeed <hi>Divinity</hi> in the opinion of the credulous deluded Antiquity was very eaſily purchaced: to <hi>diſappeare unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly</hi> was enough. Thus <hi>Romulus</hi> whoſe hyſtory is knowne to all. Thus <hi>Amilcar,</hi> a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Carthaginians in Sicily, ſeing his army defeated, whileſt he was ſacrificing, threw himſelf into the fire, where he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: thus he appeared not, &amp; for that reaſon was held to be a <hi>God,</hi> by his countrymen. <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> of <hi>Aſtypala,</hi> a wraſtler, having knocked downe his Antagoniſt with his fiſt, tore open his ſide, &amp; pulled out his hart: but in lieu of the reward he expected, finding his cruelty had
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102635:64"/>diſpleaſed the Judges, with indignation he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, &amp; finding a ſchoole maſter with his diſciples under a vault, he pulled away the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, which up held it, &amp; buryed them all with its ruins, Thence he fled into a cave, or Den, to avoyde thoſe who purſued him, to bring him to condigne punishment. But that being digged open, &amp; he not found in it, by command of the oracle, he was adored as a <hi>God.</hi> As you may ſee in <hi>Theodoret</hi> lib. 8. de Cur. Graec. affect. p. 597. &amp; l. 10. p. 631. &amp; in Plut. &amp; <hi>Suidas.</hi> Out of this perſwaſion it was that <hi>Empedocles</hi> threw himſelf into mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> that nothing of him being found they myght think him tranſlated to Heaven: &amp; he probably myght hae obtained it, ahd not his braſſe ſlippers, or ſoles, caſt out by the force of the fire, diſcoverd that he had miſtaken his way thither.</p>
               <p>By ſlyght a man otherwiſe obſcure got to be adored in <hi>Libia,</hi> as God: for having taught ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny birds to ſay: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Greate God Pſaphon</hi> (which was his name) &amp; letting them goe, they in the woods repeated this leſſon: &amp; the poople hearing them, adored him with Altars, Sacrifices &amp; Temples. He owed his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theoſis</hi> to the Birds. <hi>Anno</hi> a Carthaginian attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame; but loſt his labour, the Birds forgetting their leſſon &amp; reſuming their wild notes, aſſoone as they recovered their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:102635:65"/>
               <p> A 3. errour is, that all the Pagans belevied any <hi>Mediators,</hi> betwixt their Gods, &amp; them. In thoſe remnants of their Rituals, which are extant, there is not one word of <hi>mediation</hi> or <hi>interceſſion,</hi> demanded of the inferiour Deityes, called <hi>Dii minorum Gentium.</hi> S. Auſtin ſpeaking of that doctrine l. 8. &amp; 9. de Civit. Dei, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes to attribute it to Plato's ſchoole: as not being an article of Faith of the <hi>Heathen's</hi> creede; but a private opinion of one ſchoole of Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. He ſeemes, I ſay, to inſinuate this: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you, ſir, to shew out of <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Apuleius,</hi> or any of thoſe writers, theſe words, or any others equivalent: <hi>Hercules pray to thy father, Iupiter, for me,</hi> or <hi>us. Romulus intercede for us.</hi> So that the greateſt part of the <hi>Heathens</hi> did not dreame of this <hi>Mediation:</hi> &amp; thoſe who did aſſert it, treated nevertheleſſe with thoſe Mediators, as with tru Gods. Wherefore, should I grant that all Pagans held the ſouls of men to mediate, yet there would be a vaſt difference betwixt their ſentiments, &amp; thoſe of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, concerning our ſaints. More errors will appeare out of the following diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I think it impoſsible to give one <hi>Idea</hi> of what the Pagans taught of ſpirits or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeall ſubſtances, as this name doth comprehend the ſupreame of all, &amp; the ſubordinate, or coordinate immateriall Beings, &amp; ſouls ſeparated from their Bodys.

How hard a thing you undertake, when you deſigne a Parallel betwixt <hi>Pagan Idolatry,</hi> &amp; our <hi>Worshipping of Saints:</hi> for ſeing all depends on their holding men's ſouls to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating ſpirits (which can never be proved) or that thoſe who were good, were uſed only to preſent men's requeſts to the Supreame God, (which is the Tenet of the Catholick Church concerning Saints) which is alſo evidently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tru, we may ranke this <hi>Parallel</hi> with <hi>Squaring Circles,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone:</hi> &amp; expect to ſee the World made happy with theſe three ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rityes together.</p>
               <p>As to the mediation of Angels: <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Legat. pro Chriſt. pag. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> ſays indeed that the Chriſtian opinion was that God created ſeverall orders of Angels: &amp; had committed to their care the government of the Elements, Heavens, &amp; the whole world; not that any one Angel is Governour of the world, (which the ſcripture ſeemes to deny, Job. 34, 14. &amp; Heb. 1.14.) but that ſeverall Angels have the adminiſtration of the ſeverall parts of it. I know no Decree of the Catholick Church oblidging us to beleive this; &amp; therefore I should not dare to cenſure any man, who
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102635:66"/>should ſay the contrary. Yet that opinion hath ſo much ground in Scripture, that I do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all Mr. G. B. can ſay, to diſprove it. Joſue 5.15. an Angel is ſayd to be <hi>the Captaine of the Lord's hoſt.</hi> He ſeemes the ſame, who Dan. 12.1. is called <hi>Michael.</hi> And Dan. 10.20. there are others mentioned, viz <hi>the Princes</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Greece.</hi> And why may not theſe be the Angels, who preſided over thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes? we are ſure that all Angels are <hi>miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who shall be beyres of ſalvation.</hi> Heb. 1.14. &amp; <hi>The little ones</hi> have <hi>Angels, who in Heaven always ſee the face of God.</hi> Mat. 18.10. And that ſeverall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels aſcended, &amp; deſcended on <hi>Iacobs Ladder,</hi> Gen. 28.12. was to shew they mediated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God, who was at the top, &amp; man, who lay at the botton of the Ladder. Now, if parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Angels,</hi> have a care, or charge of particular perſons: why may not ſome others have a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſtrict, &amp; a more extended charge?</p>
               <p>This you will ſay, is taken from <hi>Paganiſme.</hi> And I will anſwer, the Pagans tooke it from the Iſraelits; not theſe from them. And it ſeemes very probable, that when the <hi>Arch-Devil,</hi> who tooke the name of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> had ſo far prevayled with men, as to be by them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the throne of <hi>God:</hi> his next attempt was, to get his wicked ſpirits acknowlged for Gouvernours of the World under him, inlieu of thoſe Bleſſed ſpirits, who were the lawfull
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102635:67"/>Gouvernours appointed by God himſelf. That order of God was not to be abrogated with the old law, of which it was no part; it being an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablishment for the more connaturall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world, from the beginning, to the end of it.</p>
               <p>I know God can governe all things by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, immediately, without the aſſiſtance, of men, or Angels: that nether the Greateneſſe of Buſineſſe can mate him, not its number confound him, nor its variety diſtract him, nor its intricacy deceive him, nor its obſcurity hide it, from his all ſeing Eye.

               <p>ANSWER. It is nether <hi>juſt,</hi> nor <hi>exact,</hi> it differs in many things. For. 1. the Pagans held thoſe men, they honoured, to be tru Gods; we belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve the greateſt Saints to be our follow ſervants. 2. Even thoſe, who owned a Deity above them, beleived it to doe nothing in Humane affayres; Job. 22.14. we believe his Providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aching all things. 3. They ſtopt in thoſe Spirits; we with them make our addreſſes to God. And 4. They offred ſacrifices to them; we offer none, but to God.</p>
               <p>This objection is not new, it was made againſt the Catholick Church above 1300. yeares a goe: to which S. Auſtin anſwerd l. 20. cont. Fauſtum cap. 21. &amp; l. 8. de Civit. D. c. 27. in the later place he hath theſe words. <hi>Quis audivit Sacerdotem ſtantem ad altare, etiam ſuper ſanctum Corpus Martyris, dicere in precibus:
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102635:68"/>Offero tibi ſacrificum ô Petre, vel Paule, vel Cypria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, cùm apud eorum memorias offeratur Deo. Iſta non eſſe ſacrificia Martyrum, novit, qui novit unum, quod Deo offertur ſacrificium Chriſtianorum. Nos itaque Martyres noſtros divinis honoribus non coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, nec ſacrificia illis offerimus. Who ever heard a Preiſt at the Altar ſay, I offer ſacrifice to thee, O Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Paul, or Cyprian, when uppon their ſepulchers it is offred to God? Thoſe are not ſacrifices of Martyrs as all know who bnow that one ſacrifice of Chriſtians which is there offred to God. Wherefore we doe not worship Martyrs with divine Adorations, nor offer ſactifice unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of which words you may learne 1. that Martyrs were worshipt in the primitive Church. 2. their Tombes were turned into Altars. 3. that the Sacrifice of Chriſtians was offred uppon thoſe tombes. &amp; 4. that that ſacrifice was offred only to the living God; &amp; not to the Martyrs. All which things to this day the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church</hi> doth very religiouſly obſerve. By which appeares the conformity of the ancient &amp; moderne Church in <hi>doctrine &amp; practice.</hi> As alſo the difformity betwixt the ancient Church, &amp; the Proteſtant Reformation, in which there is nether Martyrs worshipt, nor their tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes regarded, nor Altars, nor ſacrifice.

               <p>ANS. I deſire to learne of you, where, when &amp; by what authority this <hi>Appointment</hi> was made? <hi>Appointing</hi> is an Act of <hi>Iuriſdiction;</hi> &amp; ſoe univerſal a decree, ſoe religiouſly obeyed, muſt be a very ſolemne Act, &amp; proceede from the ſupreame Authority acknowledged on Earth. Which could not be ſoe husht up, as that no memory of it should appeare. Againe: the whole Church on Earth never pretended any Juriſdiction over Saints in Heaven, nor even over thoſe in Purgatory, whome shee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to eaſe, or releaſe, not by Judgment; but by prayer, <hi>non abſolutione, ſed ſolutione,</hi> ſay di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.

Soe that her worship ends in her ſon, or in God. This you have beene often told of by others; but are reſolved never to take notice of it, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to want this precious argument. Which is as frivolous, as it is common among your brethren.</p>
               <p>To shew you the opinion and practice of the ancient Chriſtians, three authoritys will ſuffice, one of the Latin, the reſt of the Greeke Church. The firſt is out of S.

               </p>
               <p>And S. Gregory Niſſen Orat. de laudibus Theodori Martyris. He ſays: If thy owne Prayers be not efficacions enough, <hi>If greater &amp; more powerfull interceſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be neceſſary, call together the quire of thy brethren the Martyrs, &amp; with them all pray for us.

               <p> S. Chriſoſt. hom. 1. in Theſſ. ante fin. teaches us to pray, &amp; how we should doe it, to Saint <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Let us nether deſpiſe the prayers of Saints, nor quite rely uppon them: leaſt we ether become ſlouthfull, &amp; careleſſe, or looſe their helpes. But let us pray them to pray for us, &amp; let us live vertuouſly, that we may attaine to that bliſſe which is promiſt to thoſe, who love God, through the grace of our lord I. Chriſt.</hi> No R. Catholick can explicate our doctrine more fignificantly: ſeing he explicates the object (<hi>Saints</hi>) the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>not to rely uppon them</hi> ſolely; The deſigne, <hi>to obtaine theyr Prayers for us.</hi> The finall end of all: <hi>Life everlaſting through the Grace of our Lord Ieſus-Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102635:70"/>of Saints; but of Idols, &amp; Divils: whoſe wicked example was agreate incentive to vice, (Terentius in Eunucho) as the good example of Saints is to vertu (Aug. ſupra) I have not faith enough to beleive all are Saints, where the worship of Saints is rejected: If none, but the guiltleſſe, may thtow aſtone, the Adultereſſe may eſcape in <hi>London,</hi> as well as in <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>ANS. Would you have all the world turne <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp; never worship any body? Will you condemne the cuſtome of Ingland in kneeling to our Parents? or to the Parent of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the King's Majeſty?

He should ſoe ſoone fall againe into the ſame? Apoc. 22 8. That the Angel should shew no greate diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeing himſelf adored as God, as Paul, &amp; Barnabas did on a like occaſion at Lyſtra? Act. 14.13. But should as it were compliment with an Idolater? That the Apoſtle should neverrepent himſelf of ſoe hainous a fault, &amp; doe Pennance for it? or if he did, he should not record it, that he myght as much edify by his Repentance, as he had ſcandalized by his fall? all thoſe things ſurpaſſe my <hi>Faith,</hi> althô (God

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore for the ſingular reſpect I beare the Apoſtle, I cannot ſurmiſe him guilty of Idolatry (being confirmed in Grace) eſpecially at the time of that viſion. Nay I ſee no ground to ſay, he abſolutely ſinned in it: but that he acted out of a principle of Humility, thinking that Reſpect due from him to the Angel, as being better in nature, &amp; greater in Grace &amp; Glory, then himſelfe. And the Angel corrected, that innocent Judgment, byminding him that they were <hi>follow ſervants,</hi> which was a telling him his owne dignity, of an Apoſtle: which is ſome conſiderations is even ſuperiour to the of Angels.</p>

The very prayers, which we make in our lyturgyes import that diſtinction: for they are addreſt to God, beſeeching him to heare the Prayers, which doubtleſſe the Saints make for us: or elſe When we pray to Saints, we deſire them to joyne with ours their Prayers to God: &amp; when we have obtained our requeſt we deſire them to joyne with us, in thanks giving to the divine Goodneſſe.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10, 11.</note>

               </p>
               <p>But were Truth ſought for, an end would eaſily be made of this contentious diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Faith, &amp; Calumny, hy only ſtating aryght the controversy: we doe all unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe, that God alone doth deſerve all the adoration, &amp; worship any creature is capable of, for his owne intrinſeck, &amp; eſſentiall perſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet we think it is his Pleaſure, that we should honour not only thoſe perfections in himſelf; but that we should (for his ſake) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence thoſe creatures, whome he makes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, of his infinit fullneſſe of Perfection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of their elevations, to partake of thoſe Perfections. Soe that God is
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:102635:72"/>honoured in them all, &amp; all they in him. We honour Kings &amp; Prelates lawfully eſtablishe as being Partakers of his authority to governe us; the word of God, as being an explication of his will: The Sacraments as Channells to conveygh his grace into our ſouls: Churches, as places deſigned for Prayer, to him: Saintson Earth, as living Temples of the Holy Ghoſt: Saints in Heaven, as Partakers of his glory. Sot that we may be ſayd to honour God in all: &amp; by conſequence the worship given to them cannot be ſayd to draw from God.</p>
               <p>We likewiſe profeſſe, that as God is the ſole Creator, of all things, ſoe is he the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all good: &amp; that <hi>every Good perfect Gift comes from him the Father of Lyghts.</hi> Jac. 1.13. That nothing in order to eternall life can be obtained, but of him, through our Lord Jeſus-Chriſt. That his Providence reaches to every thing, that not a hayre can etherfall of its ſelfe, or be pulled our of our head by men, or by bad, or good Angels, with out the permiſſion of God: that all we ſuffer, &amp; all we enjoy, all good, &amp; all bad, flow from his omnipotant hand, as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects ether of his mercy, or of his Juſtice, or of both. Soe that we feare nothing, but from him, nor hope for any thing, but from him. To him all our Prayers are directed, even thoſe made to Saints, which ſtop not in them, but in their, &amp; our God, &amp; father. This we beleive this we practiſe this we teach, this we defend.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102635:72"/>Speake what you can againſt this, &amp; you will ſpeake to the purpoſe, but if you paſſe this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, you beate the Ayre.</p>
               <p>Another thing I deſire of you, is, not to build uppon every little fancy, althô contrary to reaſon: which is childish always, but deſerves amore ſevere cenſure in matters of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence. Now what can be more phantaſticall, then what Mr. Brevint writes, in his <hi>Saul &amp; Samuel,</hi> that it is Idolatry to pray to Saints, unleſſe they be within compaſſe to heare us? And who can determine how far they can heare? Or what Mr. Whitby ſays in his <hi>Diſcourſe concerning Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry</hi> pag. 154. <hi>Prayer offred to an inviſible being, &amp; not corporcally preſent is due only to God.</hi> Soc that ablind man may not deſire hisneygh bour to pray for him becauſe all are inviſible to him. And Prayers offred to the <hi>Dragon,</hi> Dan 14.23. or any Idols, would be no Idolatry, ſeing they could ſee, or be ſeene, &amp; were corporeally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And certainly S.

But what proofe doth he bring for his Novelty? The authority of <hi>Dio</hi> &amp; <hi>Martial,</hi> both <hi>Pagans,</hi> &amp; one of them the moſt filthy, or beaſtly rather of all Poets.

               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. You can alleadge nothing againſt our rites, or ceremonyes, but will ſerve as well againſt your owne: &amp; what you can ſay in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of yours againſt Presbyterians, will fully ſatisfy your arguments againſt ours.</p>
               <p>It is agreate folly, to looke on Ceremonys as an eſſentiall part of our worship: &amp; it is as great to deny, that (when they are decent, &amp; ſignificant) they are greate helpes to it. Men are compoſed of Body, &amp; ſoul: with both we muſt ſerve God, &amp; each is a helpe to the other, when they concurre to worship him. The Body can doe nothing without the ſoul, &amp; all its worship is meere hypocriſy, &amp; not worthy of acceptation &amp; dead, unleſſe it be quikned by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour <hi>Faith</hi> &amp; <hi>Charity,</hi> which flow from the ſoul. And this devotion ſoone grows cold, if it be not entertained with exteriour objects, &amp; revived by ſenſible actions; Which fix the Imaginative faculty on the acts of Religion in hand, &amp; move the Will both of him, who Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiates, &amp; of the Aſſiſtants, to diſpoſitions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Rite, by a certaine ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy betwixt our ſoul, &amp; body: the ſoul feeling an inward veneration for God, to expreſſe it, inclines the body to kneeling, proſtrations, or the like: &amp; theſe encreaſe the interiour vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, when duly, &amp; devoutly made. This is the ſenſe of mankind: for there never was any
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:102635:76"/>People, who met to honour ether God, or Prince, but had ſome ſetled ceremonys, with which they expreſt exteriourly their ſubmiſſion to them.</p>

I beleive did you purſue the Prophaneneſſe ſoe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Ingland, to its heade, you will find your want, &amp; neglect of Religious ceremonys, to be the fountaine of it.</p>
               <p>In your <hi>vindication of the laws,</hi> pag. 170. you ſay the Church hath Power <hi>to determine of things, that may bedone in a variety of ways into one particular forme, ſuch as pteſcribing a ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of worship, the ordering the poſture in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the habits in worship, &amp;c.</hi> which will hedge in, what you reject as well as what you retaine.</p>

               </p>
               <p>ANS. If any Roman Catholick compared Scripture to <hi>a noſe of wax,</hi> it is only becauſe the letter may be wreſted to different ſenſes &amp; made to lookenot that way which the Holy Ghoſt deſigned; but that which men's Paſſions leade them to. The world affords not amore convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing inſtance of this flexibility of Scriptures, then that of your owne Brethren in the late troubles: who brought it to countenance <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Rebellion, Hereſy, Murther,</hi> &amp; the horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt of all <hi>Murthers, Parricide,</hi> the killing of the <hi>father of the Country.</hi> Did Scripture of it ſelfe Looke towards (or abet) all thoſe crying ſins? noſure, it condemnes them formally. It can then be wreſted from its owne naturall ſenſe, to another meaning contrary to it, which is all that is meant by that phraſe.</p>
               <p>As for its being <hi>a ſourſe of Hereſyes,</hi> it is not tru, that Scriptures, doe found hereſyes, or that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102635:79"/>hereſyesſpring out of them; but that men draw hereſyes out of the words of Scriptures, taken in a ſenſe quite contrary to that of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 41. Papiſts <hi>will have all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures to depend on the Church. A greate difference is to be made betwixt the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of a witneſſe, &amp; the authority of a Iudge. The former is not denyed to the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. Here you grant to the Church as much as we deſire, provided you owne in this <hi>witneſſe</hi> ſuch a <hi>veracity,</hi> as the nature of its <hi>Testimony</hi> requires, to bring us to a <hi>certaine,</hi> &amp; <hi>undoubted beleife</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church never tooke uppon her the title <hi>of Iudge of Scripture.</hi> In her Councils she places in the middle of the aſſembly a hygh Throne as for Chriſt, &amp; in it ſets the holy Ghoſpels as his word, according to which she Judges of the Doctrine controverted. Conc. Calced. Act. 1. <hi>Soe she judges by Scriptures of the Doctrine of men; but doth not Iudge of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the firſt admiſſion of a writing into the <hi>Canon of Scriptures,</hi> the Church proceding is of another nature. A writing is brought to her, as writen by a man Divinely aſſiſted, of S. Paul for example to the Romans by <hi>Phebe,</hi> or to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi> by a fugitive ſervant <hi>Oneſimus:</hi> nether as a witneſſe give any greate credit to the writing they brought. The Paſtors of the flocke of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102635:79"/>Chriſt conſider the writings examin, the meſſengers recurre to God by Prayer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the aſsiſtance of his Holy Spirit, to know whither he were truly the Authour of the writing exhibited. If after all theſe meanes uſed to diſcover the Truth, they remaine convinced, the thing was writen by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, they obey it themſelve, command obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, as to the word of God, &amp; uſe it as a <hi>Rule of Faith, &amp; manners.</hi> Soe when an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne perſon brings into a corporation a new Patent, as of the King's Majeſty, &amp; preſents it to the Major: He (before he allows the Patentee to act in vertu of it) with his Brethen conſiders the writing, the ſignet, the ſeale, the ſtile, &amp;c. to know whither it be counterfitte, or ſincere, with a Reſolution to obey it himſelfe, &amp; make others doe the ſame, in caſe it appeare to be truly the Kings. The Major cannot be ſayd to Judge of the Kings Patents, (to which as a ſubject he owes obedience) but only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne whither an unknowne writing be the Kings Patent, or no.</p>
               <p>You ſay: this makes <hi>the authority of Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res depend on the Church.</hi> Which is as rationall, as if you should ſay, the authority of the King's Patent depends on the Major of a petty corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, becauſe the Patent is exhibited to him, before it be executed. If any man hath ſoe little common ſenſe, as not to diſcerne the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt theſe two Propoſitions: <hi>to Iudge
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102635:80"/>of the Kings Patent: &amp; to Iudge whither an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne writing be the Kings Patent:</hi> I am to ſeeke how to helpe him.</p>
               <p>This authority of the Church, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Scriptures as an undeniable witneſſe, occaſioned that ſaying of S. Auguſtin 1. contu Epiſt. Fundam. c. 5. <hi>Ego Evangelio non crederem niſi me Eccleſiae Catholicae commoveret authoritas, I would not beleive the Ghoſpel, did not the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Catholick Church move me to it.</hi> Which words are cited by all Catholick controvertiſts, as containing an implicit deciſion of all one controverſys: they shewing evidently S. Aut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin's diſcourſe againſt the Manichees, to be juſt the ſame, which we uſe againſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Proteſtants, that as we are heyres of that Faith, which S. Auſtin, &amp; the Church of his time defended againſt its Oppoſers the Ancient Hereticks, ſoe are we of the titles, by which they enjoyed it, &amp; the armes, with which they defended it. I will put downe the whole diſcourſe of S. Auſtin atlarge that ſoe we may the better underſtand his meaning, &amp; more convincingly shew how much the moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our Adverſarys are out of the way in explicating it.</p>
               <p>The thing ſought for in that diſcourſe was whither <hi>Manichoeus</hi> was an Apoſtle of Jeſus-Chriſt, or no? The Manicheans ſayd he was: the Catholicks denyed it: for whoſe cauſe S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin diſputes thus in that place. <hi>Quaero quis ſit iſte

Illi autem credens non invenio, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modò poſſim etiam tibi credere.</hi> Haec Aug. ibi. <hi>I demand,</hi> ſays this Saint, <hi>who is this Manichaeus? You anſwer: he is the Apoſtle of Chriſt. I will not take your word for it. What will you ſay, what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes will you uſe to perſwade me? Perchance you will take the Ghoſpel, &amp; thence endeavour to prove unto me the miſsion of Manichaeus. But what if you meete with one who doth not beleive the Ghoſpel: how would you deale with him? For my part I would not beleive the Ghoſpel, did not the Authority of the Cat. Church move me. Whome therefore I obey, in ſaying beleive the Ghoſpel, should I not obey in ſaying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive not Manichaeus? Take your choice,</hi> whither you will have me ely on the Catholicks, or not <hi>If you ſay, Belive the Catholicks: they warne me, not to beleive you: wherefore beleiving them I muſt reject you. If you ſay, doe not beleive Catholicks! you doe not well, endeavouring to bring me to the Beleife in Manichaeus, by the Ghoſpel, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived only uppon the word of Catholicks, If you ſay, you doe well to beleive the Catholicks, when they commend the Ghoſpel, but you doe not well in belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102635:81"/>them, when they blame Manichaeus: doe you think me ſuch a foole, as without any reaſon, I should beleive what pleaſes you, &amp; not beleive, what you diſlike? Certainly it is much more reaſonable, ſeing I muſt beleive the Catholicks, that I abandon your communion, unleſſe you can give me an evident demonſtration for the contrary. Wherefore, if you will alleadge Reaſon: lay by the Ghoſpel. If you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Ghoſpel, I will ſticke to thoſe uppon whoſe word I have admitted the Ghoſpel: &amp; their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity forces me, to renounce you. Now if perchance you can shew out of the Ghoſpel any evident proofe of Manichaeus his Apoſtleship, you will indeed weaken in me the Authority of Catholicks, who forbid me to beleive you. But that authority being weakened, I shall no more be able to beleive the Ghoſpel, which I received by it, &amp; ſoe what ſoever you prove thence, will fall to the ground. Therefore, if no cleere proofe of Manichaeus his miſſion is extant in the Ghoſpel I will rather beleive the Catholicks, then you. If a cleere proofe be found there, I will nether beleive the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, nor you: not them, becauſe they were fals in the opinion they delivered of you; nor you becauſe you rely on that ſcripture, which I received on the teſtimony of thoſe who have deceived me. Yet god forbid, I should reject the Ghoſpel. And beleiving it, I ſee no poſſibility of beleiving you.</hi> Thus the greate Saint. Which I have cited at large, becauſe the whole diſcourſe, holds againſt all hereſyes, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging only the name of <hi>Manichaeus</hi> or <hi>Manichean,</hi> into that which ſignifyes the Hereſy: as for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102635:82"/>example into that of <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or <hi>Luther.</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reover it containes a cleere confutation, of what hath hitherto by the learnedeſt of our adverſarys beene ſayd in anſwer to it.</p>
               <p>The firſt interpretation of this place, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by W.L. <hi>in his relation of a conference,</hi> pag. 81. <hi>ſome of your o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Where he hath not one word of that. But ſays Mr. Stillingf. in his rationall account pag. 198. the words are in Durandus l. 3. inſent. d. 24. q. 1. q 9. where he ſays: <hi>Intelligitur ſolùm de Eccleſiâ, quae fuit tempore Apoſtolorum. It is underſtood only of the Church which was in time of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Author borrows another expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Biel lect. 2. in Can. Miſſae, that the words are to be underſtood of the Church in generall, as it containes the firſt, &amp; later ages, <hi>A tempore Chriſti &amp; Apoſtolorum, &amp;c.</hi> And to this he, ſticks for he addes: <hi>And ſo doth S. Auguſt. take Eccleſ. contra Fund.</hi> And D. Stillingf. p. 198. 199. approves the ſame, &amp; confirmes it, out of Gerſon, &amp; Driedo.</p>
               <p>Nether of theſe two explications can ſtand with the text: as appeares out of thoſe words: <hi>Quibus obtemperavi dicentibus, Credite Evangelio: cur eis non obtemperem dicentibus mihi, noli credere Manichaeo. Whome I obeyed in ſaying, Beleive the Ghoſpel, should I not obey in ſaying, doe not beleive
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102635:82"/>Manichaeus?</hi> Hence I frame this argument: S. Auſtin profeſſeth he received the Ghoſpel uppon the credit of that Church, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Manichaeus:</hi> but that Church, which condemned <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> was that of his time, &amp; not that of the Apoſtles, who never mentioned <hi>Manichaeus:</hi> ergo the Church, on whoſe word he received the Ghoſpel, was that of his time, &amp; not that of the Apoſtles. When therefore E. S. pag. 220. ſays: <hi>It is plain, S. Auſtin meanes not the Iudgment of the preſent Church; but of the Catholick Church, as taking in all ages, &amp; places,</hi> he evidently contradicts the very text of S. Ausſtin: whence I conclude that ether he ſpeakes againſt his conſcience, which I am unwilling to beleive; or elſe (which is more excuſable) that he had not reade the text, which he underſtakes to explicate.</p>
               <p>A third, &amp; yet more improbable, explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is delivered by W.L. pag. 82. <hi>He ſpeakes it ether of</hi> Novices, <hi>or</hi> doubters <hi>in the Faith, or elſe of ſuch as were in part</hi> Infidels, <hi>Mr. Fisher the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, at the conference would needs have it, that S. Auſtinſpake it even of the faithfull: which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet thinke: For he ſpeakes to the Manichees, &amp; they had a greate part of the</hi> Infidell <hi>in them. And the words immediatly before theſe, are: If thou shouldst find one, qui Evangelio non credit, which did not beleive the Ghoſpel, what wouldeſt thou doe to make him beleive?</hi> Thus W. L.</p>
               <p>This is like wiſe plainly fals: for S. Auſtin

               <p>G.

               </p>
               <p>ANS. Here is one of the <hi>malitious ſlyghts,</hi> of you &amp; your Brethren, when you cannot with any colour accuſe the doctrine of our Church,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102635:86"/>to pretend it is only the doctrine of ſome few perſons; that you may perſwade your Diſciples, the Generality of Catholicks hold the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

               <p>G.B. pag. 54. <hi>Adde the diſtinction of the temporary &amp; eternall punishment ſin deſerves:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102635:87"/>the later is removed by the Blood of Chriſt, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer muſt be expiated by our ſelves, ether by ſuffrings in this life, or in Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. We hold indeed a temporall paine due to ſin, after it is remitted, ſometimes; not always. For when ſin is remitted by <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> or by a <hi>perfect Act of Contrition,</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive all paine to be remitted with the ſin. But not ordinarily. And for this reaſon the Church at all times made a difference betwixt thoſe, whoſe ſins were expiated by the Sacrament of Baptiſme, &amp; of Pennance: for shee never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed any Penal workes on baptiſed perſons: &amp; never omitted impoſing them on Penitents. Which short bint, points out ſuch <hi>a cloud of witneſſes</hi> teſtifying this Truth, that it covers the whole face of the primitive Church, &amp; ſoe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it, as to diſcover its doctrine to be the ſame with ours.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more cleere to confirme this Catholick doctrine, then that a temporall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty was inflicted on David<note n="(a)" place="bottom">2. Reg. 12.14.</note> for that ſin, which uppon his crying <hi>Peccavi,</hi> had beene <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, putaway,</hi> or <hi>forgiven.</hi> A <hi>Penalty</hi> therefore or <hi>Pennance</hi> may be inflicted for a ſin forgiven, &amp; conſequently a paine is due ſometimes to it.</p>
               <p>Indeed were it not ſoe, why did our fore fathers impoſe large Pennances, after by vertu of the keyes the ſins were remitted? why doe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102635:87"/>you blame us, for impoſing ſmall Pennances, when there is, as you ſay here, none at all due?</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 54. <hi>This is contrary to the value we ſet on the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Epheſ. 2.15.16. <hi>By Christ Peace is made, we are reconciled to God, he preſents us to the Father without ſpot, wrinkle, &amp;c which declare how plenary his ſatisfaction was, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being left undone by him, for removing the guilt of ſin.</hi> Thus you. As if nothing could be required on man's ſide, in order to apply the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, without derogating from its plenitude! Chriſt ſatisfaction was <hi>plenary:</hi> ſoe was his Prayer, his Greife, his ſuffring. Yet we muſt pray for our ſelves<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Mat. 6.12.</note>, &amp; for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iac. 5.16.</note> althô he prayed for us all. And we muſt be ſorry for our ſins, the whole courſe of the Ghoſpell requires it, of us: &amp; we muſt ſuffer for, &amp; with him. For as in order of nature that action of the Prime cauſe, by which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs with creatures, is ſufficient of it ſelfe to produce the whole effect, yet nothing is done, without the concourſe of ſecondary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which apply the action of the firſt: ſoe the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is ſufficient for all, yet doth not remit our ſins actually, without it be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to us, ether by Baptiſme, or Penitentiall workes. And the neceſſity of this application by faith, is owned by all your Reformers: And if this is conſiſtent with that <hi>fullneſſe,</hi> why not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102635:88"/>application by <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; <hi>Charity?</hi>

But let us leave theſe men to reconcile together their owne thoughts which will be no ſmall, nor short labour: And examin the thing it ſelf. &amp; to come to it, I paſſe over ſeverall ſlips of our adverſarys, v.c. Wil Lawd pag. 348. ſays, that <hi>the firſt Definition of Purgatory</hi> to beleived as a <hi>divine truth,</hi> was made by the Councill of <hi>Florence.</hi> In which he is miſtaken: for Benedict XII. long before that, had defined the ſame.</p>
               <p>I prove, that the primitive Church belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Purgatory in the moſt pure times, out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102635:89"/>of the teſtimony of three Fathers, S. Hilary, S. Gregory Niſſen, &amp; S. Auſtin.</p>
               <p>S. Hilary<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Hil. in pſ. 118.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Ille indefeſſus ignis obeundus est, ſubeunda ſunt illa expia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da a peccatis animae ſupplicia. That reſtleſſe fire is to be endured: &amp; thoſe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be borne, which may purge our ſoul from ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>S. Greg. Niſſen.<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Greg. orat. de mortliis.</note> as cited by W. L. p. 351, <hi>Men muſt be purged ether by Prayers, or by the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Purgatory fire after this life.</hi> Againe. <hi>A man cannot be partaker of the divine nature unleſſe the purging fire doth take a way the ſtaines, that are in his ſoul.</hi> Againe. <hi>After this life, a Purgatory fire takes away the blots, &amp; propenſity to evill.</hi> W. L. conſidering theſe words, ingenuouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, <hi>they ſeeme plaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet he holds out one buckler againſt theſe two Arrows drawne out of the quivers of thoſe fathers: that they ſpeake of a Purgation of ſins: &amp; in the Roman Church we are taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive only a Purgation of the paine due to ſins already forgiven. Now this avayles little, 1. becauſe the <hi>debt of paine</hi> may be, &amp; often is taken for ſin, (on which it is grounded) <hi>meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimicè.</hi> 2. He ſeemes not to underſtand our doctrine: for there is no definition of our church oblidging us to beleive that there remaine no veniall ſins in Purgatory. Hence Dr. Kelliſon<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Kelliſ. in 3. p. tom. 2. p. 611.</note> late Preſident of the Inglish Colledge of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102635:90"/>Doway, proves Purgatory to be prepared firſt for thoſe who dye with only veniall ſins. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly for thoſe who dye without any ſin but only without having ſatisfyed fully for the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes due to ſins forgive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The ſame reaſons are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by D. Silvius<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Sylvius in 3. p. Suppl. q. 100. p. 350.</note> where he treates the ſame queſtion. And before theſe <hi>Benedict us XII.</hi> in his Decree. <hi>Benedict us Deus,</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>Decernimus animas decedentes cum veniali aliquo peccato, purgari poſt mortem, &amp; poſt purgationem, ante reſumptionem ſuorum corporum, &amp; judicium generale, poſt Aſcenſionem Chriſti Domini, fuiſſe, eſſe, &amp; futuras eſſe in caelo. We doe declare, that ſouls dying in veniall ſin beind purged after their death, before the generall Reſurrection are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Heaven.</hi> Which Decree you many find in magno Bullario, &amp; in Alphonſ. de Caſtro verbo <hi>Beatitudo.</hi> You ſee fir, that there is nothing in the Purgatory deſcribed by thoſe Saints incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, with what we are tought to beleive of ours. Soe W. L. or his ſquire E. S. muſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for another evaſion.</p>
               <p>W. L. cites indeed the Councill of Florence to confirme his anſwer. But that place helpes only to convince the world how perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly he read, &amp; inconſiderately framed his Judgment, uppon reading: for in the place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, the Council ſpeakes of ſouls dying in <hi>the state of Grace,</hi> or <hi>Charity, ſi in Charitate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſerint:</hi> But of their not having any veniall
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102635:90"/>ſins, not one word, unleſſe he thinks that all ſouls in Grace are free from veniall ſins, which will be another proofe of his abilityes in Divinity.</p>
               <p>My next proofe is taken from S. Auguſtin in Enchir. cap. 110. <hi>Neque negandum eſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorum animas pietate ſuorum viventium rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari, cùm pro illis ſacrificium mediatoris offertur, vel Eleemoſynae in Eccleſiâ fiunt, ſed iis haec pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt, qui cùm viverent, ut haec ſibi poſtea prodeſſe poſſent, meruerunt. Eſt enim quidam vivendi modus nec tam bonus, ut non requirat iſta poſt mortem, nec tam malus, ut ei non proſint iſta poſt mortem. Eſt verò talis in bono, ut iſta non requirat, &amp; eſt rurſus talis in malo, ut nec his valeat, cùm ex hac vitâ tranſierit, adjuvari.</hi> Similia habentur l. 21. de Civ. Dei c. 24. <hi>It ought not to be denyed, that ſouls departed are eaſed by the Piety of their ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friends, When the Sacrifice of our Mediator is offred, for them, or almes given in the Church. But thoſe are releived by theſe helpes, wholived ſoe as to deſerve the benefit of them after their death: for there is a kind of life nether ſoe good, as not to neede them, nor ſoe bad, as not to receive eaſe by them. There is another ſoe good, as not to want them, &amp; a third ſoe bad as to be incapable of helpe, even from them.</hi> Thus S. Auſtin.</p>
               <p>Where you ſee, he diſtinguishes three pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the ſouls departed, as cleerely, as Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, or the Councill of Trent. One of thoſe ſoe good, as not to neede helpe by the ſuffrages of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102635:91"/>the Church (ſuch are the Bleſſed ſouls in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) Another ſoe bad, as to be incapable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of releife by the ſuffrages, (ſuch are the wretched ſouls in Hell) A third needing them, &amp; incapable of Eaſe from them (ſuch are ſouls in Purgatory.)</p>
               <p>You ſee ſecondly cleere mention of <hi>the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our Mediator,</hi> offred by the Church in his days. What is this, but our <hi>maſſe?</hi> which you may find againe l. 10. de Civ. Dei c. 20.</p>
               <p>You ſee thirdly, this <hi>ſacrifice offred for the Deade.</hi> And laſtly you ſee, Almes given in the Church for the releife, &amp; eaſe of deceaſed friends: How many points of our <hi>Reformers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme</hi> doth this one place confute! Truly one may think, ether that they invented theſe doctrines to ſpite S. Auſtin, or that this greate Saint writ that Chapter with a Prophetick ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to convince the world that your ſentiments are no leſſe oppoſit to the ancient, then to the moderne Church, which both agree in holding out the ſame tenets in <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>E. Still. pag. 642. <hi>S. Auſtin delivers his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with ſuch feare, &amp; hiſitancy, that any me may eaſily ſee, that he was far from making it an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith.</hi> He may as well ſay, that the Councill of Trent ſpoke with heſitancy. He addes: <hi>That in S. Austin's time, many favoured Origenes his opinion, of the finall ſaluation of all, at leaſt who dyed in the Communion of the Church.</hi> But what is this to S. Auſtin who condemnes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102635:91"/>that hereticall opinion as he ſays, &amp; may be ſeene l. 21. de Civ. Dei c. 24. &amp; in the whole booke, <hi>de fide &amp; operibus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſays E. S. Auguſtin ſpeakes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully l. de fide &amp; operibus cap. 16. &amp; Enchir. cap. 69. But he should have taken notice, that he ſpeakes in thoſe places not of Purgatory in it ſelfe; but of a particular paine, which we, no leſſe then he, doubt of. The matter he treates Enchir. c. 68. is the Greife, which men feele fer the loſſe of ſuch things, which they Loved inordinately, &amp; by that meanes offended God althô their love to creatures, were not ſoe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te as to withdraw them from the foundation, Chriſt. <hi>Vrit eum rerum dolor, quas dilexcrat amiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarum; ſed non ſubvertit fundamenti ſtabilitate mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum. Such a man is burnt, and tormented with the loſſe of thoſe things, which he loved: yet he is not quite conſumed becauſe the foundation ſtands faſt.</hi> viz his love to Chriſt, whome he would ſticke to, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thô with loſſe of other things. Then follows, c. 69. where he doubts whither ſuch a purging fire, or paine as this is, shall accompagny them in the next world, that is, whither ſouls depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted retaine any diſorderly affection to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in this world, by reaſon of which, the want of them may be a torment to them, &amp;, as it were, burne them. In alike manner <hi>l. de fide &amp; operibus,</hi> cap. 16. <hi>Sivè ergò in hac vita tantum, homines iſta patiuntur,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſivè poſt hanc vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam talia quadam judicia ſubſequuntur. Whither
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102635:92"/>men ſuffer ſuch things only in this life, or the ſame rorments accompagny them into the next world.</hi> Which is a thing moderne Catholicks as much doubt of, as S. Auſtin: yet he, as well as we myght beleive moſt certainly, what he ſoe poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his Manuall, chap. CX.</p>
               <p>In vaine therefore, doth E. Still. alleadge p. 653. the blotting out of thoſe words. <hi>Conſtat animas poſt hanc vitam purgari, It is evident that ſouls are purged after this life.</hi> There is enough left in S. Auſtin's undoubted workes to confute his errour. Soe the ſucceſſe of that reformer was like that of <hi>Marcion</hi> with his ſponge, who blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out ſome parts of Scripture, yet what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained confuted his hereſy.</p>
               <p>As for holy Scripture, I think the argument which S. Auſtin uſes l. 21. de Civ. Dei cap. 23. very convincing for Purgatory. It is taken out of the words of our Saviour Mathaei 12.32. <hi>It shall be forgive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nether in this world nor in the next.</hi> Whence it follows, that ſome ſins are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the next world. <hi>Neque enim de quibuſdam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raciter diceretur, quod non eis remittatur, neque in hoc ſaeculo, neque in futuro ſaeculo, niſi eſſent, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus etſi non in iſto, tamen remittetur in futuro,</hi> Aug. l. 21. de Civit. Dei, cap. 24. Now to Mr. G. B.</p>
               <p>G.B. p. 55. <hi>For Purgatory the proofe from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was only drawne from one wreſted place of the Apoſtle Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 3.12.13.14.15.</p>
               <p>ANS. How can you ſay this, when amongſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102635:92"/>the ancients, S. Auſtin uſes another text, as we have juſt now ſeene. And Bellarmin hath nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene texts of Scripture, as your Patriark W.L. will tell you, p. 353.?</p>
               <p>G. B. <hi>The Apoſtles words containe only a Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall forme of ſpeech, to expreſſe the riſque they run.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeakes not only of <hi>ariſque,</hi> or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; but of an effectuall loſſe. <hi>He shall fuffer loſſe,</hi> Says he verſe 15.</p>
               <p>G. B. p. 55. <hi>Many viſions, &amp; apparitions were vouched for the proofe</hi> of Purgatory</p>
               <p>ANS. I never ſaw any vouched for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: I am ſure nether the Councill of Trent, nor that of Florence, nor Benedict. XII. vouched any ſuch thing for that intent.</p>
               <p>I think not our divine Faith much concerned in aſſerting the Truth of any purely humane hyſtory: &amp; I think moſt apparitions to be ſuch. Yet becauſe ſeverall Proteſtants, as well as all Atheiſts, utterly reject all ſuch relations, I deſire them to reade S. Auſtin <hi>l. de Curâ pro mortuis, cap.</hi> 10. where he ſays it would be an <hi>Impudence</hi> to deny them all. <hi>Impudenter venire videbimur, ſi haec falſa eſſe reſponderimus.</hi> And in his 16. chap. he ſays, he had learnt <hi>non incertis rumoribus, ſed teſtibus certis: not from uncertain rumours; but from undoubted withneſſes,</hi> that <hi>S. Faelix</hi> had appeared both to Citizens, &amp; ſtrangers, during the ſiege of <hi>Nola.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had you the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> which was then in the Church, you would beleive theſe things:
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102635:93"/>your denying them, which the Primitive Church, &amp; S. Auſtin beleived, shews you to be anitmted with a different Faith.</p>

               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. This objection is no product of your owne wit, you may find it, &amp; the Authors of it together with an Anſwer to, in S. Ambroſe l. 1. de Poen. c. 2. <hi>Aiunt Novatianiſe Domino de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre reverentiam, cui ſoli remittendorum criminum poteſtatem reſervant. Imò melli majorem injuriam faciunt quàm qui volunt ejus mandata reſcindere. Nam cùm ipſe in Evangelio dixerit, quaecumque li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveritis: quis eſt qui enm magis honorat, utrum qui mandatis ejus obtemperat, an qui reſiſtit? Eccleſia in utroque ſervat obedientiam, ut peccatum &amp; alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, &amp; relaxet. The Novatians,</hi> ſays this Saint, <hi>pretend to honour God, by reſerving to him alone the power of forgiving ſins. But really none are more injurious to him,</hi> (or wrong him more) <hi>then thoſe who breake his orders. For whereas he in the Ghoſpel ſayd whoſe ſins ſoever you bind. Who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God more, he who obeys his commands,</hi> by uſing that power; <hi>or he who reſiſts them? Now the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102635:93"/>Church obeys both the commands,</hi> to bind, &amp; looſe ſins, <hi>effectually binding, &amp; looſing them.</hi> Thus S. Ambroſe. You ſee, Sir, that our Doctrine now was that of the Church in S. Ambroſe's time: that the Novatians held your doctrine, &amp; made uſe of the ſame pretext as you doe, to defend their doctrine. The Church, for which S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe pleades, was Catholick: ſoe muſt we be in this, ſeing our doctrine is the ſame with theirs. The <hi>Novatians</hi> in this were <hi>Hereticks:</hi> what are you?</p>
               <p>Indeed the words, with which our B. Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

I deſire you, to shew your art &amp; invent us ſome ſpeach which in ſoe few words, shall more cleerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe this ſenſe, the Catholick Church under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands them in.</p>
               <p>And as for Fathers, ſee S. Cyprian in many places, S. Baſil. qq. brev. q. 288. S Leo epiſt. 91. ad Theodorum, Greg. hom. 26. in Evang. Cyr. Alex. lib. 12. in Joan. but above all S. Chriſoſtome l. 3. de Sacerd. c. 5. tom. 3. edit. Savell. pag. 16. <gap reason="foreign">

To them a Power is given, which nether Angels, nor Archangels enjoy: for to theſe it was never ſayd, what you shall bind. Earthly Princes have power to cast into priſon, but their Power is reſtrained to Bodyes only.

               <p>G. B. pag. 62. <hi>It was counted a Blaſphemy in Chriſt, when he ſayd, thy ſins are forgiven thee, which shews it to be blaſphemy in all others, it being an invaſion of his Prerogative.</hi>

Nos verò jejuniis aridi, &amp; omni continentiâ expreſſi, ab omni vitae fruge delati, in ſacco &amp; cinere volutantes, invidiâ coelum tundimus, Deum tangimus, &amp; cùm miſericordiam extorſerimus, Iupiter honoratur.

                  <p>Saying the <hi>Poenitentiall Pſalmes,</hi> is an object of laughter to you.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102635:98"/>Popery hath a vertu to ſanctify all Impiety: as acting againſt it did excuſe all ſacriledge. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard any man Moved to laughter with reading the Pſalmes &amp; I have knowne many by them moved to compunction, to a new life, &amp; to the love of God. Let S.

Confeſſ. c. 4. <hi>Dulce mihi ſit, ô Domine, confiteritibi, quibus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternis me ſtimulis perdomueris, &amp; quemadmodum me complanaveris humiliatis montibus, &amp; collibus cogitationum mearum, &amp; tortuoſa mea direxeris, &amp; aſpera lenieris, quas tibi, Deus meus, voces dedi, cùm legerem Pſalmos David, cantica fidelia &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos pietatis, excludentes turgidum ſpiritum. Quas tibi voces dabam in Pſalmis illis, &amp; quomodo in te inflammabar ex eis, &amp; accendebar eos recitare, ſi poſsem toto orbe terrarum adverſus typhum generis humani. I take adelyght, o my Lord, to confeſſe to thee, with what inward goades, thou didſt ſubdue me, &amp; by what meanes thou didſt bring me downe, levelling the greater, &amp; leſſer mountaines of my thoughts: How thou didſt ſtreyghten my crookedneſſe, &amp; ſmooth my roughneſſe. Into what exclamations did I breake out, O my God, when I reade the Pſalmes of David, thoſe faithfull canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, thoſe pious ſounds, which banish all proud ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. How I cryed out in reading them: how I was inflamed in the love of thee, &amp; how.

                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſons for this Pennance, are cheiſely three firſt, it is a kind of banishment, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates a man (for a time) from friends, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, home &amp; country: which cannot but be painfull, laying, a ſide the incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of travelling. And it ſeemes Juſt, that he who abuſed thoſe things, should be deprived of the comfort of them: &amp; having ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized his neyghbours by bad example, myght adify them, them, by undergoing this <hi>publicke pennance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond: it is a connaturall remedy for
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102635:100"/>ſuch ſins, (to which two or more concurre, &amp; which proceede many times from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we converſe with or preſent occaſion) to remove the ſinner from ſuch occaſions, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations: as all know, who deale with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Now this is done by <hi>Pilgrimages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third reaſon is: that althô God be in all places, &amp; ſees &amp; heares us, whereſoever weare yet he doth not alike in all places diſcloſe his <hi>Power</hi> by miracles, nor his <hi>Iuſtice</hi> by diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſecret ſins, nor his <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſion of ſinners. As S. Auſtin obſerved long ſince, &amp; day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience confirmes. S. Auſtin notes ſuch to have beene in his time the tombe of <hi>S. Felix</hi> at <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> &amp; that of the glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs at <hi>Milan.</hi> He refers this to the ſecret Iudgment of God, humbly acknowledging his owne Ignorance. Aug. epiſt. 137. <hi>Vbique quidem Deus eſt, &amp; nullo continetur vel includi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur loco, qui omnia condidt. Verum tamen adiſta quae hominibus nota ſunt, quis poteſt ejus conſilium perſcrutari, quare in aliis locis haec miracula ſiant, in aliis non ſiant?</hi> And I am content to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my ignorance in imitation of him, when nothing appeares in the place it ſelf, as ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes there doth. For if any man, who hath any <hi>lively Faith</hi> within him, should enter <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> &amp; ſee the place, where the Lamb of God was ſacrificed, &amp; the price of our Redemption Payd: Innocency condemned, the Divine wisdome derided for folly, the King of Glory
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102635:100"/>crowned with thornes, the Creator ſcoft, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his creatures, God dying, &amp; dying that painfull, &amp; ignominious death of the Croſſe. When he should think, <hi>here</hi> his flesh was torne with ſtripes; <hi>here</hi> his head was crowned with thornes: <hi>here</hi> thoſe hands, which wrought ſoe many miracles, were perced with nayles: <hi>here</hi> thoſe feete ſoe often wearyed in ſee king the loſt sheepe, were fixt to the Croſſe: <hi>Here</hi> that ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue which had command over the Elements, &amp; death, &amp; Hell, was imbued with vinager, &amp; Gall: <hi>here</hi> his ſide was opened, the laſt drop of Blood ſpilt, the life of the world dyed, to rayſe to life the world. When he conſiders this &amp; with all, that his owne ſins had ſoe greate a share, in requiring this <hi>most aboundant Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> will not the very place ſuggeſting theſe, &amp; more thoughts fixe his Imagination, quicken his fancy, detaine his underſtanding, &amp; ſtirre up his will, to <hi>a hatred</hi> of ſin, the cauſe of all this ſevere Judgement uppon the unſpotted Lamb: to <hi>confuſion</hi> for having contributed ſoe much to it by his owne offences: &amp; to <hi>love God</hi> above all things, who hath loved us ſoe much?</p>
                  <p>Hereafter before you throw ſuch hard ſtones at our heades, conſider whither there be not with us mingled, by a communion of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſome perſons to whome, you muſt owne greate reſpect to be due.</p>
                  <p>I have brought you here into an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the cheifeſt Preachers, &amp; Prelates of all
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102635:101"/>ages, all teaching commanding, or practiſing theſe workes, which you deride. The Apoſtles take up the firſt rank, &amp; over all <hi>Ieſus-Christ, God Bleſſed for evermore,</hi> preſiding, &amp; giving Example: ſuppaſe in the name of all theſe S.

                  <p>ANSWER. Can you never ſettle your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? will you let it ever be moved round with every blaſt of wind? Here our way to expiate ſins is too eaſy.

                  <p>G. B. Ibidem. <hi>The Papiſts endeavour to give a pleaſant taſt to their Pennances: wherefore to the grave, &amp; melancholy, we give of one ſort: to the fiety, &amp; ſullen, of another: to the Ioviall, a third. &amp;c.</hi>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX. <hi>Sacrifice of the</hi> Maſſe.</head>
               <p>G. B. p. 64. <hi>Another oppoſition made to the Preiſtly office of Chriſt, is their conceipt of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102635:102"/>ſacrifice of the Maſſe, which they beleive is a formall expiation of ſins, both for the living, &amp; dead, who are in Purgatory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. You fall ſoe often, that it would tire any man to take you up always. It is not tru that Catholicks hold maſſe to be a <hi>formall expiation of ſins, unica cauſa formalis, the only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cauſe of our juſtification,</hi> ſays the Council of Trent ſeſſ. 6. c. 7. <hi>is the juſtice of God, by which he makes us juſt.</hi> That is, it is habituall grace, or Charity. But let that paſſe.</p>
               <p>We ſay with the fathers, that <hi>Maſſe</hi> is an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice.</hi> S. Auſtin Enchir. c. 110. following his diſtinction of ſouls deceaſed, into three claſſes, thoſe in Heaven thoſe in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, &amp; thoſe in Hell, he ſays, that Maſſes for for the firſt are <hi>thanks givings:</hi> for the ſecond, <hi>Expiations, Propitiationes ſunt:</hi> for the third, not eaſe to the dead; but ſome comfort to their living friends. <hi>Pro valdè bonis, gratiarum actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſunt; pro non valdè malis, propitiationes ſunt: pro valdè malis, etſi nulla adjumenta mortuorum, qualeſcumque vivorum conſolationes ſunt.</hi> Enchir. cap. 110.</p>
               <p>To cleere yet more this point of the <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of Maſſe,</hi> &amp; of Chriſt offred, &amp; offring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, heare S. Auſtin l. 10. de Civit. Dei, cap. 20. <hi>Verus ille Mediator in quantum forman ſervi accipiens, mediator effectus eſt Dei &amp; homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, homo Chriſtus Ieſus, cùm informâ Deiſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium cum Patre ſumat, cum quo &amp; unus Deus eſt,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102635:102"/>tamen in formâ ſervi ſacrificium maluit eſſe, quàm ſumere, ne vel hac occaſione quiſqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exiſtimaret cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet ſacrificandum eſſe creaturae. Per hoc &amp; Sacerdos eſt, ipſe offerens, ipſe &amp; oblatio. Cujus rei Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum quotidianum eſſe voluit Eccleſiae ſacrificium. The tru Mediator by taking uppon himſelf the shape of a ſervant being made Mediator betwixt God &amp; men the man Chriſt Ieſus, who together with his father (with whome he is one God) as God receives ſacrifice, but as man will have no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offred to himſelf, to cut off all pretence of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to any, but God. In this ſacrifice, he is the Preiſt, he is the Sacrificer, &amp; he is himſelf the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. (Or he is the perſon who offers, &amp; he is the oblation.) And he hath ordred the ſacrifice of the Church, as a dayly commemoration, or Sacrament of that ſacrifice of the Croſſe.</hi> Thus he.</p>
               <p>Where you ſee a ſacrifice of the Church, as a dayly commemoration of that of the Croſſe. That Chriſt offers it; that he himſelf is offred in it, &amp; all this to God, no ſacrifice being offred to any elſe.</p>
               <p>If you are ſoe hard to pleaſe, as to be ſatisfyed with none, but thoſe of your communion. See W. L. pag. 305. where he ownes <hi>a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſacrifice</hi> to be inſtituted by Chriſt, &amp; Montagu, in his Appeale 2. p. c. 29. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges <hi>Repreſentative, Commemorative,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Sacrifice.</hi> And your Bishop of Ely Reſp. ad Apolog. Bellar. p. 184. admits likewiſe <hi>a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative ſacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:102635:103"/>
               <p> G. B. d. 6. &amp; 65. <hi>To imagine, that the Preiſts going through the Office, of the Maſſe, &amp; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the conſecrated elements can have a vertu to expiate the ſins of others, eſpecialy of the dead, is a thing ſo contrary to moſt common impreſſions, that it will puzzle a mans beleif to think any can credit it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. <hi>Your common impreſſions</hi> differ very much from thoſe of other men: ſoe you have much reaſon to ſuſpect, that they are only <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in name; but in reality, they are only <hi>private conceipts</hi> of your owne head. The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church beleives, what you think <hi>none belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> S. Auſtin beleived it, all Catholicks pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, our Councils define it, our Catechiſmes teach it, our pulpits preach it, &amp; our Paſtors proclaime it. Yet you would faine perſwade the world no body beleives it, that the thing is incredibile. As if you knew better whas paſſes in our harts, then we our ſelves. But if this be not an <hi>honeſt way,</hi> it is at leaſt, <hi>cunning,</hi> to take for granted, what you cannot prove; &amp; it is caſyer, to find a ſlyght to ſteale into your wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke readers opinions, then to gaine it by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall reaſon.</p>
               <p>G. B. Ibidem. <hi>The Preiſts receiving the conſecrated Elements, cannot avayle another</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. We doe not beleive the Paſſion of Chriſt to be applyed by the Preiſts taking the Hoſt, but by the eſſentiall part of the ſacrifice, which conſiſts in another action.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:102635:103"/>
               <p> G. B. pag. 65. <hi>It is abſurd to think, one man's action can be derived to another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. An article of our Faith muſt then be <hi>abſurd,</hi> viz <hi>the Communion of Saints,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a mutuall communication of good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes amongſt the members of the Church, the the myſticall body of Chriſt. See <hi>Pearſon</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit. Symboli p. 714. where he proves it out of 1. Jo. l. 7. <hi>If we walk in the lyght, we have fellowship with one another.</hi> The Greeke ſays, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Communication with one another.</hi> And out of col. 2.19. <hi>Holding the head, from which all the body by joints, &amp; bands having nourishment miniſtred, &amp; knit together, encreaſeth with the encreaſe of God.</hi> Soe that, as in a naturall body all parts doe communicate to one another their nourishment, in the Philoſophy of the Apoſtle, ſoe in his Divinity all parts of the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall body, the Church, communicate their good workes. What ſay you ſir? how like you your cenſure, which involves an article of the Apoſtles creede, &amp; two Apoſtles? Have I not reaſon to admonish you, to regard where you shoote your bolts, &amp; throw your ſtones, for that they can ſcarce lyght on any place of our doctrine, or on us, without hitting the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, &amp; the Holy ghoſt, &amp; many times tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe points of faith, which you your ſelf admit.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 65. <hi>It clearly appeares from the Inſtitution of the Lords ſupper, that its end was
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102635:104"/>the joint communicating of Beleivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. <hi>It clearly appeares,</hi> that you little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what you ſay, The <hi>Primary end of its inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> &amp; indeed that which only is ſpecifyed by our Saviour is to be a commemoration of his Paſſion, &amp; the Sacrifice of the Croſſe. <hi>Doe this in memory of me.</hi> As for the <hi>joint commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> it can only be a ſecondary intention of the inſtitution, the <hi>firſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>cheife</hi> being <hi>our union with Chriſt</hi> out of which flows the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>our union amongſt our ſelves.</hi> As lines in a circle meete in the center, &amp; ſoe knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

               <p>G. B. pag. 66. <hi>I advance to the oppoſition made to the Regall office of Chriſt, &amp; firſt how far is it from his Glory in Heaven, to beleive that five words muttred by a Preiſt should put him under the Elements. This is a new kind of humiliation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. You are very much miſtaken,

                  <hi>When God brought his first begotten into the world,</hi> he ſayd: <hi>And let all the Angels of God worship him.</hi> Yet he was then humbled to the condition, of a man, a private obſcure man, and even below it, (Pſ. 21.7.) <hi>Opprobrium hominum &amp; abjectio plebis.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there is more shew of Majeſty, as he is placed on our Altars, envitoned with lyghts, adored by the People, Prelates, &amp; Princes, the greateſt Monarks laying their crownes, &amp; the greateſt Bishops, their Croziers &amp; Miters at his feete, then as he was in the little cottage of his reputed father a Carpenter, picking Chips at his mothers command, or following his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers trade to get a ſubſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, knowne to none, regarded by none, ſlyghted by all, as is ordinary to men of that humble calling. And what shall I ſay of the death of the croſſe, when his very diſciples diſowned him?</p>
               <p>G. B. p, 67. <hi>What low thoughts of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt it breade in ſuch minds, as are capble of beleiving this contrivance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. You ſpeake like a <hi>Pagan,</hi> to whome the <hi>Croſſe of Chriſt is folly,</hi> (1. Cor. 1.23.) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then like a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to whome <hi>Chriſt crucifyed</hi> (that is, under the greateſt Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>is the vertu &amp; wisdome of God.</hi> We who have learnt to looke or him as <hi>God Bleſſed for evermore,</hi> even when on the Croſſe, &amp; dying
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102635:105"/>we can take out of all his Humiliations occaſion to admire his love, &amp; adore his goodneſſe to us: but not to diſeſteeme his perſon, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish our thoughts of his Majeſty. And let me tell you, you are the firſt <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I know of, who ever made ſuch <hi>unchriſtian</hi> reflections on the <hi>Humiliations of the ſon of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. p. 67.68.69. &amp; 70. In theſe you charge us, with three crimes. 1. With adding to the laws of Chriſt. 2. Diſpenſing with the laws of God. &amp; 3. Commanding things indifferent contrary to <hi>Chriſtian liberty.</hi> I Anſwer to the firſt, &amp; third: the Apoſtles did the ſame <hi>(a)</hi> forbidding <hi>ſtrangled meate, &amp; Blood,</hi> which were things indifferent, &amp; not forbidden by the law of Chriſt, And as to your objection, that <hi>this entrenches uppon Chriſtian liberty,</hi> I answer out a perſon very deare to you, even your ſelfe, in your <hi>vindication,</hi> confer. 2. p. 172. <hi>Chriſtian liberty is ſtated in an exemption from the laws of Moyſes.</hi> Shew that we impoſe <hi>the law of Moyſes,</hi> &amp; you will ſay ſomething to the purpoſe, fo our <hi>entrenching uppon Chriſtian liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Diſpenſing in Divine laws,</hi> when you prove what you object, I will conſider what to anſwer. Your inſtances are not ſufficient. For firſt as for <hi>diſpenſing of vows,</hi> there is an <hi>Epirkia</hi> in them, as in laws, which is an interpretation of ſome circumſtances, in which they doe not oblidge: for example. A man vows to faſt, next, lent with breade &amp; water: &amp; before that time
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102635:105"/>falls ſicke &amp; continues ſoe: why may not the Church declare his vow not to oblidge, or change it into ſomething elſe? Item he vows a Pilgrimage: &amp; his wife, family &amp; affayres re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his preſence at home? If this doth not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy you, call to mind the procedings of your firſt Reformers, who opened all Cloiſters, &amp; diſpenſed with ſoe many vows, at one time. Is it not ſtrange, that you should charge us with <hi>diſpenſing with ſome vows,</hi> when you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null all?</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>diſolving wedlock bond.</hi> I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne who practice diſſolving conſummated mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. If you doe, accuſe them: if you doe not, aske pardon for this falſe accuſation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly <hi>allowing marriages in for fidden degrees.</hi> The degrees hindring marriage were contained in the ceremoniall law, which expired with Chriſt, the end of that law. Thoſe which now bind, are eſtablisht by canon law, which was made, &amp; doth depend on the Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly the communion under one kind, or <hi>the Chalice taken from the people contrary to the command of Chriſt.</hi> You can never prove <hi>that command</hi> to all, to drink of the Cup.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 71. <hi>Another invaſion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Power, is the Popes pretence to be univerſall Bishop, which is termed by S. Gregory the greate to be Antichriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. I know no Pope, who pretends to it; I know none, who give it them. If there

               <p>Now I deſire you, to make good ſenſe of ſomething, you ſay: firſt <hi>p.</hi> 67. <hi>Chriſt hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered us from the bondage of corruption,</hi> How is this done already, when the Apoſtle, (whoſe words thoſe are, Rom. 8.21.) promiſes it only after the Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Secondly pag. 68. <hi>Anathema is the mildeſt of the ſpirituall cenſures, we thunder against ſuch as comply not with our tyranny.</hi> What <hi>ſpirituall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> Is more ſevere? I think that the ſevereſt of all, as we beleive after Tertul. Apolog. cap. 39. p. 68.</p>
               <p>Thirdly pag. 69. <hi>No authority beſides Chriſt can reach the conſcience.</hi> S. Paul was of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinion, when he enjoines obedience to the commands of Princes, <hi>not only, for wrath, but for Conſcience.</hi>

Your words &amp; phraſes are greate, &amp; hygh, your Reaſon, &amp; ſenſe low, &amp; little, yet that delivered with ſoe much conſidence as may perſwade your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, &amp; Credulous Reader, you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on your ſide, when you are to ſeeke in the firſt principles of the matter, you diſcourſe on. You may with a homely, yet a very proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphore be compared to a <hi>flying Oxe,</hi> whoſe wings ſtretcht out promiſe a flyght, but his heavy body keepes him on the ground, &amp; his dull ſpirits ſerve only for a ſlow motion there. For let a man reade your booke, obſerve your diſeſteeme of others, &amp; your inſulting over them, &amp; he shall think you, Eagle like, to be to wring above the clouds, whence you with diſdaine looke downe on us poore Ignoramuſes. Yet your heygth is diſcernable without the helpe of a <hi>Teleſcope:</hi> for after all your ſtriving, &amp; ſtraining endeavours, we ſtill find you on the ground, equall, nay inferiour to many, whome you inſult over without any thing extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but your boldneſſe to print in ſoe learned an Age, as this is, of things you underſtand not. If what I have written already, &amp; what I shall write, doth not make this cleere, I will give you leave to apply that comariſon to me.</p>
               <p>I have already ſpoken (Chap. 3. &amp; 4.) of

                  <p>In fine, althô, with Divines, we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that theſe two greate vertus may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, yet we hold their ſeparation to be their ruin: that as <hi>Charity</hi> is but ſuperficiall; &amp; not reall, without the lyght of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſoe <hi>Faith</hi> is cold, without the warmth of <hi>Charity.</hi> He, who knows God, without loving him, is impious:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102635:115"/>&amp; he who loves without knowing him aryght, is Blind. A Beleiver without Love is Ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: a Lover without knowledge is ſenſeleſſe ſoe theſe two vertus muſt aſſiſt one another; we muſt aime to have <hi>a Living Faith, which workes by loue.</hi> Galat. 5.6. &amp; <hi>Love</hi> is the proper worke, of <hi>Faith. Opus Fidei dilectio.</hi> Aug. tr. 10. in epiſt. Jo. <hi>Love</hi> both gives to, &amp; receives ſtrength from <hi>Faith. Charitas robur Fidei: Fides fortitudo Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis.</hi> S. Leoſerm. 7. in Quadrag. In Heaven there is <hi>Love,</hi> without <hi>Faith</hi> (1. Cor. 13.8.10.) In Hell, <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Love</hi> (Jac. 2.19.) Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in this life muſt have both: for <hi>Love</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Faith,</hi> is the <hi>Love of Pagans;</hi> &amp; <hi>Faith</hi> without <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Faith of Devils.</hi> But <hi>Faith with Charity,</hi> is the <hi>Faith</hi> of the children of God in this life. <hi>Fides quae per dilectionem operatur, ipſa eſt Fides quae fideles Dei ſeparat ab immundis daemonibus.</hi> Aug. de gratiâ, &amp; lib. arbit. cap. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thus we joyne together thoſe two greate vertues: this we beleive, this we teach of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> whileſt you out of ill grounded opinion of your <hi>Fac totum, Faith</hi> (relying on it for <hi>Remiſſion of ſins, Iuſtification, Perſeverance,</hi> &amp; <hi>Salvation</hi>) exhauſt your Rhetorick ſoe much in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that your darling, that you have no roome to commend <hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Good workes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Practice as much ſurpaſſes yours, as to nourishing <hi>Charity,</hi> as our doctrine doth: for ſcing the love of God, &amp; <hi>Love of our ſelves,</hi> are oppoſit, &amp; the one withers, as the others thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102635:115"/>their practice muſt be moſt proper to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish charity, which aimes moſt at mortifyng <hi>ſelve-love:</hi> &amp; on the contrary thoſe who foſter <hi>ſelfe-love,</hi> muſt annihilate <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what practice can you shew for the mortification of the body, the quelling our Paſſions, the renouncing of our will? what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments doe you give for theſe? what exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples can you shew ſince your reformation of them? you have never beene able to find in the three kingdomes a dozen perſons of ether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex who for ſoe many yeares, would ſequeſter themſelves from the enjoyments of the world, to ſerve God, in voluntary Poverty, Chaſtity, &amp; Obedience. Whence comes this, but from <hi>ſelve-love,</hi> which abounds in them, &amp; the lacke of the love of God, which myght cement their harts together?</p>
                  <p>Whence comes that inſupportable Pride, which makes your Proſelits ſoe refractory to God, &amp; his vicars, their ſpirituall, &amp; temporall ſuperiors, that they are ſoe tenacious of their extravagant phancyes, ſoe ſtubborne in their uncouth Reſolutions, ſoe intractable in their manners, ſo humour ſome in all their actions, &amp; converſations; but a latent Pride, the proper of-ſpring of <hi>ſelve-love,</hi> &amp; the bane of Charity? Looke into the 13. Chapter of the firſt to the Corinthians, you shall there find a deſcription of charity, &amp; its qualityes. <hi>Charity ſuffreth long, &amp; is kind: Charity envieth not: Charity vaunteth
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102635:116"/>not it ſelfe, is not puffed up: Doth not behave it ſelfe unſeemely: Seeketh not her owne, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evill, Reioyceth not in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, but Rejoyceth in the truth, Beareth all things, beleiveth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi> Should I now examin the life of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all, who deliver themſelves to your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection uppon theſe heades, &amp; shew how little of this appeares in your manners, &amp; how much there is quite contrary to it, the picture, if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, would fryght you, or confound you, how greate ſoever your confidence be.</p>

                  <p>G. B. Ibidem. <hi>Doth not the feare of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory damp the hopes of future Bleſſedneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ANS. It doth not.</p>
                  <p>G. B. p. 79. <hi>What impious doctrine hath beene printed in that Church,</hi> of the degree of love, we owe to God?</p>
                  <p>ANS. I know of no ſuch doctrine of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of love due to God. I know that all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks applaude that ſaying of S. Bernard: <hi>Modus amandi Deum eſt amare ſine modo.</hi> I know that divines require as well as S. Thomas, a mediocry in all vertues except <hi>Charity:</hi> that all vertues are betwixt two vices, where of one offends by exceeding, the other by not reaching its due meſure. And this they aſſure even of <hi>Hope,</hi> which is betwixt <hi>preſumption,</hi> and <hi>deſpayre:</hi> &amp; of <hi>faith,</hi> which is betwixt a lyghtneſſe of hart beleiving all things, &amp; a hardneſſe to beleive any thing: love cannot be too greate, &amp; ſoe hath only one vice contrary to it, by <hi>defect,</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving too little.

                  </p>
                  <p>Hence what you ſay: <hi>Some mincing it ſo, as if they were afrayde of his being too much beloved:</hi> This I ſay, is an untruth: &amp; I challenge you to produce your Authors, or to be held a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator.</p>
                  <p>G. B. Ibidem: <hi>Some blaſphemouſly teach, that we are not at all bound to love him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ANSW. This is alſo untru. All acknowledge
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102635:117"/>a precept, to love God. But this being a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive precept; which oblidges only for ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate time, ſome Authours have enquired when that time is? And in reſolving this obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re undecided queſtion there have beene ſome variety of ſentiments, without any difference as to the ſubſtance of the precept. If God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to you a deciſion of this intricate queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, bleſſe the world with that information, &amp; prove well, what you ſay: &amp; I aſſure you we will not blame you for it.</p>
                  <p>G. B. Ibidem. <hi>There is an Impiety in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls of ſome of that Church particularly amongſt the diſciples of</hi> Loyola <hi>beyond what ever was taught amongſt the worſt of Heathen Philoſophers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ANSWER 1. You are no competent Judge, in matter of <hi>Piety,</hi> as being acquainted nether with the practice, nor Theory of it.</p>
                  <p>ANSWER. 2. You are not ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the cauſe, in which you preſume to Judge: having no knowledge at all of one ſide, &amp; but a very ſuperficiall knowledge of the other.

               <p>ANSWER. Many alive ſtill remember, when the Godly could find out Plots, dangerous Plots, Popish Plots, in every innocent recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Perſons whome they miſliked. You imitate exactly thoſe factious ſectarys, in fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying the like dangerous contrivances.

Are we taught, to do our workes with a good intention? A Popish deſigne againſt Piety, Are Sacraments connected with Grace, &amp; ſayd to be efficacious ſignes of it? It lookes like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne againſt Piety. And what ſoever we doe, theſe People ſuſpect <hi>a Deſigne,</hi> againſt Piety. As of the Jews, Iſayas<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102635:118"/>populus iſte, conjuratio eſt.</hi> Soe much were they fryghted then, with the Apprehenſion of the union betwixt the two kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp; <hi>Syria,</hi> &amp; ſoe ſtruck are you likewiſe with the apprehenſions of <hi>Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jews ſurmized <hi>A Confederacy</hi> out of <hi>a reall feare.</hi> The factious old <hi>Parlimentarians,</hi> out of <hi>a pretended Feare.</hi> What moves you? a reall, or only pretended <hi>Feare?</hi> or doe you ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke out of Ignorance of our Tenets? or ill will to our perſons? ether may eaſilier be ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then any reall feare, or concerne for Piety.</p>
               <p>We have beene taught to acknowledge ſome vertu in the Sacraments of the new law, (<hi>in vertu of Chriſt's inſtitution,</hi> &amp; becauſe they are the inſtruments to apply the merits of his Paſſion to our ſoul) which was not in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old law, nor in any ceremony of humane inſtitution: for S.

                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.9.</note> calls the Sacraments of the old law, <hi>weake &amp; beggarly Elements,</hi> in compariſon doubtleſſe of thoſe of the new. Theſe then are more efficacious, <hi>ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger &amp; richer.</hi> Yet the others could ſtirre up the receiver to an in ward diſpoſition, for Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, nay a ceremony of meere humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution may have that force. Wherefore the Sacraments of the new law muſt, <hi>by the worke wrought</hi> doe more, then to ſtirre up the receiver to good Workes.</p>

We unanimouſly teach, that a bad diſpoſition of the receiver puts a ſtop, <hi>(ponit obicem)</hi> to the effect of the Sacrament, &amp; is it ſelf a ſacriledge: &amp; that the Sacrament ſoe received unmorthily, ſerves for the damnation of the receiver, as thoſe who receive the body &amp; Blood of Chriſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</note>

                  <hi>CHAPTER XXIV.</hi> Probable Opinions, &amp; Good Intentions.</head>
               <p>G. B. p. 81. <hi>Chriſt came to fullfill the morall law.</hi> Mat. 5.7.</p>
               <p>ANSWER. Whence doe you learne, that thoſe words of Chriſt are reſtrained to the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law?</hi> did not Chriſt fullfill the <hi>ceremoniall law</hi> alſo? ſure he did, both as Antitype, &amp; as never treſpaſſing againſt it.</p>
               <p>G. B. p. 82. <hi>Two generall doctrines they have, which at two ſtrokes diſſolve all the bonds of vertu.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102635:119"/>The one is the doctrine of Probability: the other of geod intention. By the firſt they teach that with a ſafe conſcience a man may follow what any Doctor teaches: &amp; ſome repreſenting the worſt actions as good, there is ſcarce any ſin, but may the ventured on. By the ſecond he may act any ſin, provided he intend ſome good deſigne.</hi> And then you ſend us to the <hi>Provinciall Letters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. What if the Authour of thoſe letters, being no Divine, was miſtaken in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thoſe opinions? what if he renounced the whole party which had engaged him to write in that ſcurrilous manner? what if he was ſorry before his death, to have dealt ſo much with them? what if this can be proved under his Curat's hand? now this is the plaine Truth, as appeares by this following <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> given by the Curat of <hi>S. Stephen-uppon-the-Hill,</hi> to the then Arch-Bishop of Paris. Here is the ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Aujourd'huy 7. Janvier 1665. Nous Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doüin de Perefixe Archeveſque de Paris, ſur ce que nous aurions apris, que Monſieur Paſcal, lequel avoit la reputation d'avoir eſté fort attaché au party des Janſeniſtes, eſtoit decedé dans la Paroiſſe de S. Eſtienne, &amp; qu'il yeſtoit mort ſans recevoir les Sacremens, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vons deſiré ſçavoir de Mr. Paul Beurrier Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligieux de S. Genevieve, &amp; Curé de S. Eſtien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, ſi ce qu'on nous avoit rapporté étoit vray, qu'il fut mort attaché au party des Janſeniſtes.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102635:119"/>Sur quoy ayant interrogé ledit Sieur Curé de S. Eſtienne, &amp; ſommé de dire la verité, aprés l'avoir promis, a répondu, qu'il avoit connu ledit Sieur <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſix ſemaines avant ſon decés, qu'il l'avoit confeſſé pluſieurs fois, &amp; admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtré le S. Viatique, &amp; le Sacrement d'Extreme Onction, &amp; que dans toutes les converſations qu'il a eu avec luy pendant ſa maladie, il a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marqué que ſes ſentimens étoyent toûjours fort Orthodoxes, &amp; ſomis parfaitement à l'Egliſe, &amp; à N.S.P. le Pape. De plus il luy a témoigné dans une converſation familiere, qu'on l'avoit autrefois embaraſſé dans le party de ces Meſsieurs, mais que depuis deux ans il s'en étoit retiré, parce qu'il avoit remarqué, qu'ils alloyent trop avant dans les matieres de la Grace, &amp; qu'ils paroiſſoyent avoir moins de ſoumiſſion, qu'ils ne devoyent, pour N.S.P. le Pape........ Et que depuis deux ans, il s'é<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toit tout à fait attaché aux affaires de ſonſalut, &amp; aun deſſein qu'il avoit contre les Athées, &amp; les Politiques de ce temps en matiere de Religion....... F. P. BEURRIER.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee here in this Declaration ſigned by the Curate, who aſſiſted the Authour of the <hi>Provinciall Letters,</hi> at this Death, that he had beene engaged, or entangled, in the party of the <hi>Ianſeniſts,</hi> that he found their ſentiments were not tolerable, or orthodox, in thoſe two capitall points, of <hi>Grace,</hi> &amp; <hi>Submiſsion to the ſea Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick:</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:102635:120"/>that uppon that ſcore he had withdrawne from them, &amp; abandoned them. Yet you will have us goe to him. Well: I will comply with you: &amp; from him I learne two things: one, that he blames ſome caſes of private men. Another, that thoſe cannot be charged on the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church. Thus if Iſtand to his verdit your accuſation will be caſt out of the court, as lying againſt the whole; not againſt a part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If you ſay: beleive him when he accuſes ſome, but not when he abſolves others, doe you think us ſoe weake, as to give credit to him, when you pleaſe, &amp; when you pleaſe to recall it? what is this, but to give, &amp; at the ſome time take away his judiciall authority? to name him Judge Arbiter, &amp; tye him to ſpeake only what you pleaſe. But I will leave him, &amp; ſpeake to the thing.</p>
               <p>That you may conceive, what are <hi>probable opinions,</hi> you are to take notice, that <hi>morall actions</hi> may be reduced to four claſſes: to ſuch as are <hi>evidently good, evidently bad, uncertain,</hi> &amp; <hi>indifferent:</hi> according as they are related to the law (whither <hi>Divine Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> or Civill) which is their proper Rule. Thoſe are <hi>evidently good,</hi> which are cleerly conformable to the law: As to <hi>love God:</hi> or <hi>deale with others as we would bedealt by.</hi> Thoſe are <hi>evidenly bad,</hi> which are contrary to the law: as to <hi>blaſpheme God,</hi> or to <hi>wrong our neyghbour.</hi> Thoſe are <hi>indifferent,</hi> which are nether commanded, nor forbidden, as to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102635:120"/>wash your hands<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Mat. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> before eating, uſed by the Phariſyes. Thoſe are <hi>uncertain,</hi> when a law is knowne, but it is unknowne whither it oblid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in ſome circumſtances. For example: the reſiſting an enemy<note n="(b)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Macchab.</hi> 2.38.</note> who attackes you, on a <hi>Sabboth day,</hi> &amp; repayring the breahes which he makes.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt claſſe <hi>Actions evidently good, Probability</hi> doth not looke on them, as its object.</p>
               <p>The ſame for thoſe, which are <hi>evidently bad:</hi> They can never be committed without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God. If any hold the contrary, ſtone him; the ſtones will not hit me, nor any Jeſuit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by ſuch an accident, as befell <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi> when directing his thunder bolt at a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, he miſt him, &amp; hit, &amp; fired Pallas her Temple. And what you ſay, of <hi>committing any any ſin, with directing intention,</hi> is ſoe greate a calumny, that no <hi>good intention</hi> of <hi>oppoſing Popery,</hi> will excuſe it.</p>
               <p>The third claſſe, of <hi>Actions uncertaine</hi> in themſelves, are properly the object of <hi>probable Opinions:</hi> whileſt it is not certaine whither the laws oblidges <hi>hic, &amp; nunc,</hi> or no, in theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which are not ſpecifyed in the law: yet alter very much the nature of the Action. There being no evident principle to shew it to be lawfull, or unlawfull, the Judgment we fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of it, muſt be an <hi>Opinion</hi> only, &amp; if the reaſon
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102635:121"/>be ſtrong, it is called a <hi>probable Opinion.</hi> For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: the Jews<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Macab.</hi> 2.40.41.</note> (hearing that their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had beene aſſaulted on a Sabboth, &amp; not reſiſting, for feare of breaking the Sabboth by working on it, were all killed,) Reſolved not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that command to make what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they could on that day. Which Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was grounded on a <hi>probable opinion:</hi> for on the one ſide was the let er of the law prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all labour on that day: then, they myght think God would protect them, whilſt they kept his law, as he<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.24.</note> conſerved their goods; whilſt they went thrice a yeare to the Temple: &amp; if he did not pleaſe to defend them miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, they myght think, it was his will, that they should glorify him by giving their lives, rather then breake his commandment: which perſwaſion poſſeſt the greateſt part of Chril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, neere the Apoſtles times, as may be ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in Tert. Apologetick. On the other ſide, they conſidered the law of nature oblidging to ſeeke ſelfe-preſervation: &amp; that to expect a miracle was to tempt God, &amp;c. Hence they concluded, that it was lawfull to labour for <hi>ſelfe defence</hi> even on the Sabboth.</p>
               <p>To make an <hi>Opinion probable,</hi> Suarez<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Suarez diſ. <hi>12.</hi> de bonit. &amp; malit.</note> requires that it be nether contrary to the ſenſe of the Church, nor to any opinions commonly received, &amp; that it be grounded on Authority,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102635:121"/>&amp; Reaſon greate above exception. All Divines even the largeſt, require <hi>a wayghty motive, a ſtrong reaſon,</hi> &amp; that even co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>payring it with the contrary motives: otherwiſe they agree, that the <hi>Opinion</hi> will not be <hi>probable;</hi> but <hi>dangerous, rash,</hi> &amp; <hi>improbable.</hi> See two large treatiſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by R. F. <hi>Antony Teril,</hi> (agreate ornament of the Society, &amp; an honour to our Nation) in defence of this <hi>Rule of conſcience.</hi> You will find in him a ſolide diſcourſe, well grounded, &amp; gravely handled, as Truth should be delivered; without any of that <hi>Booffonnerye,</hi> which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnyes the Authour of the <hi>Provinciall Letters,</hi> which may be tolerable in a <hi>Comedy,</hi> but not in a treatiſe of <hi>Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I think cannot be doubted of <hi>in Theſi,</hi> or in generall. I will not deny, but <hi>in hypotheſi,</hi> in particular doubts, or queſtions ſome men have not ſtucke ſoe cloſe to the letter of the law, as they should: as <hi>Fr. Teril</hi> doth deplore. But thoſe men's aſſertions doe not take away what we have ſayd: for their private ſentiments, not well grounded, deſerve not the name of <hi>probable Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt claſſe of <hi>Actions,</hi> are thoſe called <hi>indifferent,</hi> as not being mentioned in any law. Theſe muſt draw all the morality they have <hi>Ex intentione ſive voluntate operantis.</hi> In thoſe a good intention of the man who produces them, or his will to doe them for the love of God, gives them a good morality, which of themſelves
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102635:122"/>they have not: as on the contrary a bad inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives them the nature of fin.</p>
               <p>Hence what you ſay, that our doctrine is, <hi>any ſin may be committed innocently, by directing our intention,</hi> is a greate <hi>untruth,</hi> &amp; as greate a <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny.</hi> No <hi>intention</hi> can juſtify a bad Action; but a bad intention may vitiate the beſt action: as to give an Almes<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.2.</note> for vanity. <hi>Bonum ex inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grâ causâ, malum ex quocumque defectu,</hi> is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime never more true, then in morall actions. We are taught in the Catholick Church, not only to doe good things; but to doe them well: not only to doe juſte things; but to dothem juſtly: nor pious things; but piouſly, <hi>non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm bona, juſta, pia; verum etiam benè, juſtè, piè.</hi> Nay a pious moderne Authour ſays, that God regards more the Adverbes; then the nounes, or verbes: for example: A Judge heares atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively a cauſe pleaded before him, in order to give ſentence, <hi>ſecundùm allegata &amp; probata:</hi> the action of it ſelfe is good; yet his intention may mend, or marre it. Doth he that, for his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full allowance, it is of ſmall merit. Regards he his duty to his Prince, &amp; country; it is better: If for God, it is beſt of all. But doth he intend by it to pleaſure a freind, or practice Revenge on an enemy, althô his ſentence be juſt; yet he is unjuſt in pronouncing it, to ſatisfy his owne paſſions of <hi>love,</hi> or <hi>hatred.</hi> This is our doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, this we teach, this we practice, which
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102635:122"/>you underſtand not: &amp; your perpetuall fault is, <hi>to ſpeake</hi>

               </p>
               <p>ANS. What you charge ou us here <hi>(not kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Sabbath)</hi> was charged on our <hi>Saviour,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> by the <hi>Scribes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Phariſyes,</hi> &amp; is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> by the <hi>Puritans.</hi> I doe not deny, but many are defective in this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, &amp; that as other commands, ſoe this, hath ſuffred. Yet I think, I could as eaſily find inſtances for the very things, you reproch to us amongſt you, as you amongſt us. I will nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe all that is done amongſt Catholicks, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive you would find it hard enough to juſtiſy all that is done by yours. Yet I will tell you, that unleſſe you will condemne Chriſt, &amp; his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, &amp; iuſtify the ſlaunders of the Scribes, &amp;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102635:124"/>Phariſyes againſt them, you muſt acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge that there is a <hi>preciſeneſſe</hi> of <hi>Duty,</hi> not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Alm. God. And it is very remarkable, that ſeveral accuſations of the Breach of the Sabbath having beene brought to our Saviour, by the Scribes &amp; Phariſyes, Chriſt always bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their blind, indiſcreete Zeale, &amp; retorted the accuſations, alleadging ſeverall of their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes undefenfable; but never ſeconded the accuſation; quite contrary, ether confounded the accuſers, by minding them of their owne faults, or excuſed the fact from guilt. Which is a ſufficient proofe, that the law of God doth not require that ſuperſtitious obſervance which the Scribes, the Puritans, &amp; you require, for want of which you blame us, &amp; are your ſelfe blamed by others.</p>
               <p>Yet I will not excuſe all that is done by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in this matter, which cannot be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the Church, becauſe shee condemnes, &amp; cenſures it.</p>
               <p>I muſt take notice here of a <hi>craft</hi> you uſe in this place, to <hi>mingle tru &amp; falſe things together.</hi> For example pag. 85. <hi>That children may lawfully intend killing their Parents:</hi> (Is falſe) <hi>that they may marry without their conſent,</hi> is doubted by none, I think, as to the validity of the marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, unleſſe there be ſome municipall laws pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding againſt it.

                  <hi>thought it a ſigne of a good conſcience to ſpeake ill of every body.</hi> You may with the ignorant multitude much eaſyer obtaine the eſteeme of <hi>Piety</hi> &amp; <hi>Zeale</hi> by ſpeaking ill of others, then doing well your ſelfe, &amp; by blaming others lives, then correcting your owne.

               <p>FRom p. 91. titt. 100. we have a long enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the Riches &amp; Pride, &amp; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Popes, Cardinals, Bishops, Abbots, &amp; all Churchmen. You blame the ſumptuouſneſſe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102635:125"/>of our Church ornaments, the ſolemnity of our Proceſſions, the majeſty of our Ceremonys, &amp;c. which things being not of Faith, I think my ſelfe notoblidged to anſwer further, then by shewing a good uſe may be made of them.</p>
               <p>I grant that Chriſt founded his Church in reall Poverly: he ſent his Apoſtles to preach with order to live<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 10: 8.</note> uppon what they found in the places whither, they went: &amp; be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with what was given them. He gave them a ryght to a ſubſiſtance: declaring that<note n="(b)" place="bottom">

                  <hi>a worke man deſerves his diet.</hi> And that<note n="(c)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>he who ſerves the Altar, ought to live of it.</hi> And althô S. Paul wat pleaſed not to make uſe of this Ryght commonly, for a very good reaſon: yet the reſt did &amp; he myght lawfully have done every where, &amp; actually did it at <hi>Philippi</hi> (Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 4.15.) Yet I doe not find that ever our B. Saviour ſtinted the Apoſtles, ſoe as if any thing were freely given, beyond what was mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely neceſſary, they should be oblidged to refuſe it, or reſtore the overplus to the donors. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe I find your Brethren in the miniſtry commend very much your firſt Reformers for retrenching ſome of your Bishop's lands, althô they left enough for not only a <hi>competent</hi> but a <hi>noble ſubſiſtance:</hi> nay your moderne<note n="(d)" place="bottom">W. L. &amp; Heylin.</note> writers accuſe them of ſacrilege. And I doe not heare, that your richer Bishops, doe breake their shins
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102635:126"/>with haſt, to reſtore the ſurplus of their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to the heyres of the donors: which they were bound to reſtore, if it were not lawfull for Churchmen to enjoy more, then what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Since the fall of Religion, indeed the Proteſtant Church hath not much encreaſed her revenues: which rather proceedes form lack of charity in your layty, who give you nothing: (or becauſe the wife, &amp; children ſweepe away what remaines by each incumbent at his death) then to your love of Poverty, for which vertu you have refuſed it, when offred. I have heard, at leaſt of none, who would refuſe a mannor, (or other conſiderable Boone) when freely given: &amp; the hard uſage, which ſome of your tenants complaine of, from their Eccleſiaſticall landlords, proves ſufficiently, that you are not inſenſible to the allurements of the attractive metall.</p>
               <p>Were Church men ſuch as they ought to be the layty would have little reaſon to repine at their riches, althô much greater then they are. If they were Treaſurers of the Poore, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Orphans, Helps to widdows, Hoſts to ſtrangers, Protectors to the Oppreſſed, &amp; common Sanctuaryes to all neceſſitous perſons ſuch as ſome are in Catholick Church<hi rend="sup">s</hi>, whome I know, &amp; many of whome we reade. To ſuch as theſe Riches are no hindrance to their func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they give them only occaſion of doing much good, &amp; practicing their Charity. If you
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102635:126"/>think this to be blame worthy, althô Riches be ſoe imployed, prove what you ſay out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: &amp; excuſe your owne Bishops from that crime, <hi>&amp; eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Voluntary reall Poverty</hi> is much commended in the<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

A man may be a begger, &amp; yet be far from that <hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> which gives him a ryght to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, becauſe his hart is fixt uppon things he hath not.

                  <hi>uſe the world, as if he uſed it not.</hi> Of this ſort of poore of ſpirit there are many in the Church, &amp; always have beene. Heare S.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102635:127"/>no uſe of the world: there are others, who uſe it, of if they uſed it not.</hi> What hath the Proteſtant Church to ſay here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pride,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ambition</hi> are perſonall vices: ſoe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to this treatiſe. Yet I will ſay, that there have beene both Ancient &amp; Moderne Popes, who have given greater examples of humility, then any your Church can shew; &amp; who have made appeare, that their title, <hi>ſervant of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God,</hi> is no compliment. Sixtus V. would not owne his mother, when she was brought to him in rich clothes: ſayng <hi>his mothers was a poore woman, who never wore ſilkes in her life,</hi> shee was ashepe heards wife. The next day she being brought to him in Rags, he preſently acknowledged her. Some of them have aſſerted the Priviledges of their chaire, againſt ſuch as in trenched on their Ryghts: which may be done without any Pride at all, ſeing they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it as due, not to their owne perſons; but to their chair, to its founders, S. Peter, &amp; to his ſuperiour, <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> I never heard <hi>S. Ambroſe</hi> ſuſpected of <hi>Pride,</hi> for refuſing to admit <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> the greate into the Church, before his Pennance for the ſlaughter at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> or for excluding him the cancells after it. It was a Zeale of the glory of God, &amp; the good of the Church, which moved him: the Emperour him ſelfe underſtood it ſo.</p>
               <p>As for precious ornaments of the Church: I will owne ours, to be too coſtly, when you
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102635:127"/>shall have proved, that any thing is too good for God's ſervice; not till then. The infinite Majeſty of God is ground ſufficient to oblidge us to beare him the greateſt reſpect interiourly, &amp; expreſſe our duty to our Creator, &amp; our gratitude to ſoe greate a benefactour, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to him in the beſt manner we can an acknowledgement of his moſt bountifull gifts. This ſerves alſo to ſtirre up in the auditory ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, reſpect &amp; adoration, which otherwiſe would fayle.</p>

               <p>G.B. pag. 100. <hi>A fourth deſigne of Chriſtian Religion was to unite man kind under one head into one body, not by love, &amp; pardoning injurys only; but alſo by aſſociating the faithfull into one body, the Church, which was to be united by bonds of love: Governed by Paſtors &amp; Teachers, &amp; cemented with the ligaments of the Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. You ſay ſomething (though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corderly)
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102635:128"/>but not all: for 1. you omit <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we are inſerted into the body of Chriſt. 2.

You adde <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which are only exteriour ſignes of interiour commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. 4. You confound <hi>Charity</hi> &amp; <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> as equally concurring to the <hi>Vnity of the Church:</hi> yet there is a vaſt difference betwixt them: the one formally quickning the members of the Church interiourly, the other only ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it interiourly, &amp; teſtifying it exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly. 5. Betwixt the Sacraments there is a vaſt difference, as to this (&amp; you confound them) for <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> being our Regeneration in Chriſt, is an efficient cauſe of our union with him, &amp; makes us his members: the others are deſigned only to nourish thoſe, who are already united to, &amp; in him. When you ſpeake of <hi>being governed by Paſtors,</hi> I hope the <hi>Pope</hi> may find place amongſt them, he being the <hi>prime Paſtor.</hi>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102635:128"/>but God: &amp; if any <hi>man pretend to command, he changeth the authority of the Church into a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call yoke.</hi> Soe we muſt have <hi>Governours,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>authority</hi> to <hi>command:</hi> &amp; <hi>ſubjects,</hi> without any <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>obey.</hi> A new model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>

               </p>
               <p>ANS. Never man ſpake more, &amp; proved leſſe then you: who offer not one word in proofe of theſe diſputed points, which we declare to be <hi>evident untruths.</hi> Is not this a poore begging of the thing in queſtion? But they are, ſay you, <hi>additions to your Faith.</hi> Did we adde to your Faith: or you cut off from ours, &amp; that of the whole Chriſtian world, before your deforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How could we adde thoſe things to your Faith, when they were in peacable poſſeſſion all over the Chriſtian world, as you owne your ſelves, many ages before <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> was thought on?</p>
               <p>You have here only one truth viz. that <hi>you withdrew from the Church.</hi> Which convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly proves the guilt of <hi>Schiſme</hi> to lye at your dore.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 105. <hi>If a Society of Chriſtians vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſwerve from Chriſt, ſoe that communion cannot
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102635:129"/>be retained with it, without departing from Chriſt, then the departing from the corruptions hrought in, can be no departing from the Church. If then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that the Roman Church hath departed from the truth of the Ghoſpel, thoſe who ſeparated from her cannot be ſayd to ſeparate from the tru Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Here we have a Paralogiſme, which myght better become a <hi>Iunior Sophiſter,</hi> then a <hi>Chaplaine in ordinary to his Majeſty.</hi> You will ſee it in theſe inſtances: <hi>The communion of that Church ought to be renounced, which oblidgeth her Children to Mahometiſme. If then the Inglish Proteſtant Church oblidge hers to that, her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ought to be renounced.</hi> Another: <hi>That man deſerves the greateſt contempt, who writes contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, &amp; hath nothing to write, but calumnyes &amp; Sophiſmes.

               <p>There is no Logician, but knows that <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Propoſitions</hi> ſignify only the connextion betwixt two things under ſuch a condition; but they aſſert nothing abſolutely, unleſſe the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> be proved. For example: <hi>If a man ſlyes, he hath wings: If the Heavens fall we shall catch lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</hi> Theſe, I ſay are granted to be trn, althô the condition be impoſſible. Yet thoſe who grant them, doe not expect thoſe wings, to goe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:102635:129"/>a Journy, nor rely on thoſe larkes for a ſupper. In like manner ſuppoſe we should grant your conditionall illation, yet the guilt of ſchiſme would lye on our conſciences, becauſe you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe, nor can prove the <hi>condition</hi> uppon which your excuſe relyes.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 106. <hi>The cruelty</hi> of Papiſts <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it ſelf to as much bloody, &amp; barbarous rage, as ever ſprung from Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSW. You meane, the laws made againſt Hereticks: which being made by the ſecular Power, &amp; not by Churchmen, I think my ſelfe not oblidged to vindicate them. Yet ſeing the moſt ſevere of them all, the faggot, was til of late (as I am informed) in force in Ingland, &amp; hath beene actually <hi>executed</hi> uppon ſome ſince the <hi>Reformation,</hi> I leave you to Anſwer to our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Judges, for your Pragmaticall bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in cenſuring them ſoe ſeverely. Another would take notice of the laws in force againſt Papiſts: But I let that paſſe. It is enough to vindicate our Churchmen, that they never made thoſe laws, they never condemned any man to them. All they doe is to Judge of the matter of fact, whither a perſon be guilty of Hereſy: &amp; if they find him ſoe, to leave him to the ſecular Power. This is the moſt, that ever the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> did, as far as I ever heard.</p>
               <p>G. B. p. 108. <hi>Grotius ſays, that in Charles the V.'s time more, then one hundred thouſand, were
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102635:130"/>butchered on the account of Religion. And in his ſon Philip's time the D.d' Alva did in a short time cut downe</hi> 36000.</p>
               <p>ANSWER. <hi>Grotius</hi> was an eminent man for ſeverall things; but not renowned for his skill in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> I have heard from one well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, that he could not count ten: that he knew not the ordinary currant mony of his country: that when he eſcaped out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he had like to have beene diſcovered by a ferry man, by that ignorance; he was ſoe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it. Soe I should not wonder, that he were miſtaken in his calculation of ſoe many thouſands. Secondly, it is probable, hereckons into the number of thoſe butchered, ſuch as perished in the Boores war in Germany, &amp; wars of the low countrys: whoſe death muſt be put to the account of their <hi>Rebellion,</hi> not to that of <hi>Religion.</hi> Thirdly he writ in favour, &amp; defence of the <hi>States</hi> cauſe: to whoſe vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was neceſſary, that the motives of their taking armes againſt their Soveraine, should be aggravated to the utmoſt. We all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the infamous inſcription put over the <hi>Niche,</hi> where the ſtatue of the late King of Happy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſtood: all the world knows that without any diſparageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the reſt there never before had beene a king, who leſſe deſerved ſuch a title; yet no doubt had that uſurped Government continued, ſtoryes would have beene invented to prove it, &amp; thoſe concerned in the Rebellion,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102635:130"/>would have beleived them, as you doe <hi>Grotius.</hi> Laſtly ſuppoſe all <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays tru, It follows only, that it was the misfortune of thoſe greate Princes to have many offenders in that kind in their time, provoke the sword of Juſtice. As if in Ingland a ſpirit of theiving should ſpreade it ſelfe amongſt the People, for which in the time of the beſt of Kings many may ſuffer, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reflecting on the honour of the King, or equity of the laws. Theſe are not <hi>crimes</hi> of the Government; but <hi>misfortunes,</hi> for which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be pittyed, not reproached with them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. You cannot diſcover better who is your maſter, &amp; what a proficient you are in his ſchoole, then by venting ſuch palpable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths. Cardinal <hi>Barbarin</hi> Deane of the Sacred Colledge hath beene knowne, to accompany many times malefactors to the Gallows, heard their confeſſions, moved them to a deteſtation of the ſins, which brought the in to that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, rayſed them up to hopes of pardon through the merits of our b. Saviour: &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them with hopes of a happy life, after that tragicall end of this. I name him in particular becauſe he is, knowne to many of our Nation, who have &amp; doe acknowledge his civilitye to to them, althô of a different perſwaſion. In time of the greate Plague, under Alexander VII. he viſited in perſon places infected, inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after the wants, informed of the diligence of the Officers appointed for the releife of the ſicke, &amp; provided according as occaſions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both for ſoul, &amp; body. <hi>S. Charles Borromeus, a Cardinal &amp; Arch Bishop</hi> gave ſoe greate exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Paſtorall Vigilancy, &amp; Apoſtolicall Zeale, that none of our Reformed Prelates ever will imitate them. Your confidence is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in relating ſuch evident untruths, which all who have ſeene France or Flanders can contradict. Inquire of the life of the preſent
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102635:131"/>Lord Bishop of Gant: of ſeverall in France: &amp; if you have one ounce of good blood in your body, ſome of it will appeare on your face.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 112. <hi>I deny not, but not even theſe laſt ages have produced greate men amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts who ſeeme to have deſigned the reviving of the ancient diſcipline, both among the Clergy, &amp; the people. But as theſe inſtances are rare, ſo they were hated, &amp; perſecuted: witneſſe Arnold's booke of the frequent communion, Ianſenius &amp; S. Cyran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. There is no pretence more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, or even fatall to both Church &amp; ſtate, then that of <hi>reforming abuſes,</hi> &amp; <hi>reviving antiquated laws,</hi> which ſerves every <hi>Pragmaticall head,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as he hath reade the ancient ſtatutes, or Canons (though the underſtands the ſenſe of nether) to detract from the preſent governme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; (if by meeting others as rash as himſelf, he is enabled for ſuch awork) to endeavour the change of it, under the ſpecious pretext of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> You muſt owne the truth of this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you will juſtify the late rebellion in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, which was begun, carryed on, &amp; finisht under that colour.</p>
               <p>The opinions of men are as different, as their faces, ſcarce ever two alike: educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, diet, company, freinds, buſineſſe, &amp; other extrinſick occaſions alter our Judgment of things: many more have influence on our Judgment of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, But moſt of all, love &amp; hatred have an imperceptible, yet unreſiſtible force over

               <p>It it a greate error, to think that every one who blames another, hath Reaſon for it.

               <p>Governments are more obnoxious to cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res as including greater variety of Actions &amp; deſignes, in which more perſons are concerned as Acting in, or ſuffring by them. This makes a vaſt diverſity of Iudgments of Iudgments in ſeverall perſons, according as they fancy themſelves regarded, or neglected, advanced, or kept backe, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102635:133"/>or prejudiced by them: &amp; according as they hope, or feare from them. A private man poſſeſt with an opinion, of his owne abilitye, (which no body ſees, but himſelfe, nor he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but through ſelfe-love) shall think him ſelf as fit to fit at the Helme, as thoſe who doe: &amp; finding his preferment not to anſwer the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he hath of his owne capacity, thinks him ſelfe wronged by thoſe, who are advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. To revenge this imaginary wrong, he commits a reallone, by blaſpheming hygher &amp; lower Powers, calumniating their Actions, cenſuring their commands, &amp; judging their judgments. Erecting within himſelf (through a criminall rashneſſe, &amp; ridiculous Ambition) a <hi>Tribunall</hi> over thoſe, to whome by <hi>Publick Authority,</hi> he is <hi>ſubject.</hi> This man by ſome wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then himſelf, shall be looked on as a wiſe man, a Zealot of the publick good, &amp; a <hi>good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot:</hi> when in reality not Prudence but Paſſion governes his tongue: Which only vents ſome indigeſted choler.</p>
               <p>I grant that in all governments there are ſome inconveniences, which we may wish were corrected. The Paſſions of ſome, the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneſſe of others, cauſe diſorders, which may be puniſht; but not prevented. Thoſe who governe, are not always at their owne diſpoſall ſometimes to pleaſure their friends, ſometimes to accoyde diſpleaſing others, they are in a manner forced to ſome things, which were
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102635:133"/>they left to themſelves they would not doe. They muſt ſometimes give way to a leſſer evill to avoyde greater. In which they deſerve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compaſſion, then Blame: more over they are indeed greater then others, yet not Gods; but men: not omniſcient; but ignorant of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which paſſe in their government, &amp; it may be are acted in their name, &amp; by their authority, yet contrary to their intentions, which are (ſuppoſed to be) always, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke good. It may be they know the thing, &amp; diſlike it; but know not how to remedy it without ſome other inconvenience (the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding of all faults, is reſerved for Heaven) Amongſt men, he is beſt, who hath feweſt faults, not he who hath none (ſuch an one is a <hi>thymera</hi>) &amp; ſmall ones may be connived at, in conſideration of greate vertues. Thus every private man ought to ſuppoſe that the ſupreme magiſtrate ether doth not know the faults of thoſe he employes, or thinks them not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, or knows not how to remedy them without incurring others as greate, or greater.</p>
               <p>What is the duty then of a private man, who ſees theſe miſcarriages? 1. To pray God, to mend all, or at leaſt to prevent bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. 2. If they have occaſion &amp; abilityes to acquaint thoſe, who may redreſſe things, with what he thinks a miſſe &amp; ſuggeſt, if he can a proper remedy: yet to leave the applying
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102635:134"/>that remedy to thoſe who are charged with the publicke concerne. 3. In caſe he be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in common, or private ſufferings, he ought to beare it patiently, &amp; expect the turne of the Tyde. 4. He may reforme his owne life, &amp; actions according to the ſevereſt laws of ſtate &amp; cannons of the Church provided he beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, not by that trouble ſome to his neyghbours (over whome he hath no authority) or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ſuperiors (whoſe authority over him is eſtablitht by God) or diſturb the publicke Peace, which is to be preferd before all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which can be hoped from thoſe petty <hi>Reformers,</hi> or their <hi>Reformations.</hi> 5.

This appeares firſt by her Councils, even that of Trent, &amp; ſeverall celebrated in France, &amp;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102635:135"/>Germany, in this laſt age. Secondly by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſeveral Prelates, <hi>S. Charles Borromeus</hi> in Italy, <hi>S.

But his perſonall endowments, other to good or evill, were exceeding greate: A large, &amp; comprehenſive phancy, a tenacious memory, &amp; a Judgment, to uſe all his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſeaſonably: Deepe melancholy, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with aduſt choler was his temper: the firſt fitted him for the labour of hard ſtudyes: the ſecond emboldened him to write, whatſoever be fancyed, without any regard to perſons how greate ſoever. Thoſe who particularly knew him, ſay, that no hiſtory shews a man of a more intriguing wit, &amp; fitter to head a faction. For uſing too much this faculty, he was by the King's authority caſt into priſon, being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by a Bishop (whome he had before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vehgled) who diſcovered his deſignes through horrour of them. <hi>Cardinal de Richelieu</hi> being ſolicited to releaſe him R.S. late Bishop of Calcedon, anſwerd. <hi>You Lordship doth not know the man you ſpeake for.

                  <q>Now I would know of Mr. B. whither it be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for a private man, to caball in his owne Church, to frame a party in it beſides &amp; contrary to the orders of its lawfull ſuperiors, oppoſe all eſtablisht order, to unſettle old cuſtomes, &amp; introduce new ones, to make

And why myght not that faculty retrench from its body members, who refuſe to ſubmit to the major part; as by the law of nature all are bound to doe, where there appeares no ſin? I know of no other perſecution he ever endured. As to his booke of the <hi>frequent Communion,</hi> it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not the reforming, but to the deſtroying the Sacrament of Pennance, as is ſeene by its effects, where it prevayles.

               <p>ANSWER. Here are acompany of hard words to fryght your Reader from Rome, as Birds are fryghte from corne with a rattle: &amp; there is likewiſe more noyſe, then ſubſtance in both.</p>
               <p>I have lived in the greateſt Catholicks Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces dominions, &amp; never ſaw, nor heard, of what you ſay is dayly done. Our Canons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire 30. yeares for a bishop: few are made ſoe young moſt are promoted to that dignity very ancient. Yet this age being determined only by Eccleſiaſticall law, I will not deny, but that on ſome extraordinary motive ſome have beene diſpenſed with. If you blame this, ſee how you will excuſe S.

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102635:137"/>how will you excuſe your owne, in which they are practiſed? muſt the <hi>canon law</hi> be a <hi>cablerop</hi> to us, &amp; a <hi>cob web</hi> to you? If you diſlike <hi>plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lityes,</hi> begin with reforming your owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, his majeſtyes <hi>Chapplins in ordinary,</hi> who can find a conſcience to keepe two Benefices, if they meete with a Prince who will beſtow them.</p>

                  </note> I demand, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not lawfull for a Bishop to be abſent from his Dioceſe in the circumſtances following 1.

For the good of their Dioceſes, as when <hi>Flavianus,</hi> Patriarck of Antioch went to Conſtantinople, to preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve his Epiſcopal ſeate from being ruined, by appeaſing <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the greate offended for the throwing downe of this ſtatues? 4. For any other reaſon ſoe weyghty, that evidently it may be equivalent to the good, which his reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce myght bring? No Papiſts thinks them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full but only on ſuch occaſions: for as for ſuch, who do abſent themſelves ether for ambition, or Enuy, or pleaſure, or friend ship, or any other unlawfull deſigne; or for ſome good, but ſoe little, as not to countervayle that of their duty to their flock, we no leſſe blame them, then you: our cannons for Reſidence are as ſevere, as can be, &amp; thoſe often executed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

               <p>
                  <hi>Commendams</hi> offend you, that is, the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the meanes of Abbyes to thoſe who are not monks. Yet we give them only to cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-youto mere lay men. Secondly we give them only for their lives; you give them to their heyres executors, adminiſtrators, &amp; aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. 3. We leave the Abby, &amp; its legall ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors a competent ſubſiſtance for othe monks. You turne them a begging, out of God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into the warme ſun. When you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it is more lawfull for you Church to ſteale a Gooſe, then forours, to pluck a quill, I shall beleive your procedure <hi>legall,</hi> &amp; outs <hi>illegall.</hi>

In fine, as the Iews proceeded with our Saviour the Bridgroome, ſoe do you with the Bride, the Catholick Church her Actions what ever

                  <p>ANSWER. <hi>You have</hi> indeed <hi>run a round</hi> &amp; that ſo long, that you are <hi>giddy</hi> with it, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by your frequent, &amp; greate falls, ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently againſt common ſenſe, as I have all a long obſerved, &amp; yet I have not obſerved all, for that would have been too tedious to the Reader, &amp; have taken up more time, then I can beſtow uppon trifles.

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102635:139"/>diſcovers a <hi>deſigne</hi> againſt <hi>Charity,</hi> which is the Hart of Religion, it being a heape of rash Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments evident calumnyes, or uncharitable ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes, I ſay nothing of your faults againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon your incoherentnotions, groundleſſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; perpetuall ſophiſmes: becauſe althô theſe are greate faults in themſelves, yet not conſiderable, in preſence of thoſe others againſt <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And theſe faults are the greater, for being brought to up hold a <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> a <hi>deſigne</hi> contrary to Chriſtianity: it being a moſt certaine Truth that <hi>noman can have the love of God, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the union of all men in one Church.

                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:102635:139"/>came to my mind, who repreſented the Piety of Catholicks, &amp; the vicious lives of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyes, in his two bookes <hi>de moribus Eccleſiae Catholicae,</hi> &amp; <hi>de moribus Manichaeorum,</hi> &amp; I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined you myght deſigne the like in the two parts of this booke. I expected you would have given us a <hi>Panegyrick</hi> of your owne Church, after you had ſpent your Satyricall veine on your <hi>invective</hi> againſt ours. I thought we should have ſeene deſcribed the Beauty of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Church, the advantages of Communion with it, the perfection of its Faith, the decency of its ceremonys, the Majeſty of its Hierarchy, the reaſonableſſe of its cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the fullneſſe of its conducency to Piety in this life, &amp; Bliſſe in the next. And all theſe confirmed with examples of the vertuous lives of its devotes.</p>
                  <p>But how much have I been miſtaken I for caſting an eye a little further, after ſome few words in commendation of your Faith, I find you throwing dirt againe, as faſt, as before: or rather faſter, as if in the firſt part you had only eſſayed, what in the ſecond you act in ear neſt.</p>
                  <p>Doth your Garden (the Church, Cant. 4.12. is compared to one) afford only that one flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer? Is the ſoyle ſo barren, or ſo ill cultivated, as none elſe should be found in it? or if there be any other doe they thrive ſo ill, as not to be worth being pointed to? Or doth it come from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of nature, which inclines you to blame,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102635:140"/>&amp; reprehend? or from a propenſity to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thoughts only of faults, &amp; imperfections, as flyes pitch uppon ulceres, &amp; ſome other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures wallow in mire? or from another quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty worſe then that, which turnes all to bad, as a foul ſtomacke turnes all food into peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, &amp; a ſpider draws Poyſon from that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, whence a Bee draws Hony? ſomething of this muſt be: for I will nether ſay there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reprehenſible in the lives of Catholicks, it is a propriety of the <hi>Triumphant Church</hi> to be free from any <hi>ſpot, or wrinkle:</hi> nor that all is bad in Proteſtant beſides their Faith that being the condition of the damned ſpirits in Hell.

               <p>G.B. pag. 116. <hi>The firſt Character of our Faith, is that it was delivered to the world by men ſent of God, &amp; divinely inſpired, who proved their miſsion by miracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. All <hi>Divine Faith</hi> is built to the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102635:140"/>veracity of God: the men, who delivered it at firſt, were but the organs by which God ſpake, &amp; their <hi>Words</hi> were his <hi>words.

Theſſ. 2.15. <hi>Which when you received of us, you received it not as the word of men; but (as it is in truth) the word of God.</hi> Hence thoſe men frequently uſe that phraſe: <hi>Haec dicit Dominus. Thus ſays the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Faith</hi> is no further a Theologicall vertu, then it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, ſolely, &amp; only, on the truth <hi>(Veracity)</hi> of God, as on its formall object: as with our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; out of them Dr. Pearſon, in his learned explication on the Creede teaches. And in this even thoſe men <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Divinely inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red proceded as we doe, reſolving their <hi>Faith</hi> into the veracity of God as well, as we: for their faith was <hi>univoca,</hi> of the ſome nature with ours, with this only difference, that the formall object was applyed to them cleerely, &amp; to us only obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely. The aſſent to ſuch a myſtery in Chriſt was <hi>ſcience,</hi> or <hi>viſion;</hi> not ſoe in any others: he myght ſay,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Io.</hi> 3.11.</note>

               </p>
               <p>In this manner faith was firſt ſpreade in the world. I ſay the <hi>Catholick faith;</hi> not your <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant faith,</hi> which as it containes your poſitive, &amp; negative articles (otherwiſe it is not <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>)
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102635:141"/>was never delivered by any man divinely inſpired; but invented by your firſt Reformers, who (as I have ſayd chap. 22. ſ. 1.) taking the whole ſumme of <hi>faith revealed,</hi> topt, &amp; lopt off it as much, as they pleaſed, &amp; from them you have not the <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> but the <hi>Proteſtant faith, Fides temporum, non Evangeliorum; a faith of the times not of the Ghoſpels,</hi> ſays Tertul. <hi>Were theſe the men of God divinely inſpired &amp; aſſiſted by miracles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 116. <hi>The doctrines about which we differ, can pretend to no ſuch divine Originall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. You know we hold this not to be tru: we receved all by the ſome authority, from the ſame hand.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 117. <hi>What man ſent of God was the firſt Authour of the beleife of the corporall preſence, of the Sacriſice of the Maſſe, of the Popes ſupremacy, of Purgatory, of Indulgences, &amp; of all thoſe innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſuperſtitions; of which ſcripture is abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely ſilent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. Chriſt was a <hi>man ſent of God,</hi> &amp; he was the <hi>firſt Authour of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. Ibidem. <hi>If theſe doctrines were not the off ſpring of Revelations, we cannot be oblidged to beleive them as ſuch.</hi>

               <p>ANS. Your former <hi>legerdemain</hi> comes again, another conviction of your diſingenous procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. This appeares by theſe Propoſitions: <hi>If the Bible were not the off ſpring of Revelation, we should not be bound to beleive it. If Chriſt were not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102635:141"/>tru God, we should not be bound to adore him as ſuch.</hi> Could you with patience heare a Pagan with ſuch a ſlyght undermine the authority of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> of the honour doe to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Prove what you odiouſly ſuggeſt, that the things you wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> are not revealed: &amp; you will doe ſomething to the purpoſe. But you are too cunning to attempt any ſuch proofe, which you know ſurpaſſes your ſtrength. And there fore you had rather ſuppoſe then prove it, that being more proportioned to your <hi>capacity,</hi> &amp; <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. Ibidem. <hi>They vouch Scriptures for proofe to ſome of theſe, but theſe are ſoe far ſtretched, that their ſure retreate is in the Sanctuary of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. You ſpeake as dogmatically, as if it were <hi>ex Tripode.</hi> Here is an Aſſertion without any proofe: &amp; ſoe is a convincing proofe, that you have none. <hi>Tradition</hi> is indeede <hi>our Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> to which you have no claime. By it we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 1. Scriptures, 2. the ſenſe of Scriptures, which is their ſoul.</p>
               <p>Now when Scriptures are doubtfull in any point, or as you phraſe it, ſeeme not to reach home, without <hi>Stretching,</hi> can we have better aſſurance of their tru meaning, then by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, which is cleerely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended us in Scriptures themſelves.

               </p>
               <p>ANS. Unleſſe you prove, that errours have crept in that way, you are inexcuſable. You actually rejected thoſe things, as errours, which were in poſſeſſion all over the world: unleſſe you prove them to be ſuch, your fact is cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall.</p>
               <p>G. B. Ibidem. <hi>It is not poſſible to know what Traditions came from the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. <hi>Habemus hic confitentem reum.</hi> For if it be impoſſible to know what <hi>Traditions</hi> were <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> your Reformers act in rejecting ſoe many, was rash, &amp; inconſiderate. They had beene better adviſed, to retaine all, as they found them in the Church, them to cut them off. But your proceedure is as different in this as in the reſt, from S. Auſtin. For was any thing doubted of: this Saint's methode was to conſult the Church, &amp; adhere to what shee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived, or practiſed; (as you ſee in his diſcourſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102635:142"/>above) you conſult the Church too, but it is only to reject her practice, &amp; condemne her ſentiments,</p>
               <p>The weyght of the authority of the Church may be ſufficient, to convince which are <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Traditions,</hi> as it convinces which are <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall writings.</hi> Yet we have other ſignes. I will inſtance in two one taken from S. Auſtin l. 4. de Bapt. contra Donat. cap. 24. <hi>Quod uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa tenet Eccleſia, nec à Conciliis inſtitutum, ſed ſemper retentum est, non niſi Apoſtolicâ traditum auctoritate rectiſsimè creditur. We ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive thoſe things to have come from the Apoſtles, which the whole Church holds, &amp; were not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Councills; but were always in uſe.</hi> To prove this, it is enough, that the firſt perſons, who mention them, ſpeake of them, not as of things newly begun; but which were of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient practice.</p>
               <p>The ſecond rule is taken out of Tertullian l. de praeſcript. c. 28. <hi>Age nunc omnes erraverint, deceptus ſit &amp; Apoſtolus de teſtimonio reddendo quibuſdam, nullam reſpexerit Spiritus ſanctus, uti eam in veritatem induceret, ad hoc miſſus eſt à Chriſto, ad hoc poſtulatus de Patre, ut eſſet Doctor veritatis, neglexerit officium Dei villicus, Chriſti vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carius, ſinens Eccleſias aliter in terris intelligere, aliter credere, quàm ipſe per Apoſtolos praedicabat. Ecquid veriſimile eſt ut tot ac tantae Eccleſiae in una<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fidem erraverint? Nullus inter multos eventus eſt unus exitus, variaſſe debuerat error doctrinae Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiarum.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102635:143"/>Coeterùm quod apud multos unum invenitur non eſt erratum, ſed traditum. Suppoſe</hi> ſays he, <hi>that all churchs have erred that the Apoſtle was deceived in the teſtimony he gave to ſome the holy Ghoſt looked to none, to leade it into truth to which intent he was ſent by the ſon, &amp; demanded of the father, to be the Doctor of truth: let the ſteward of God, the Vicar of Chriſt neglect his duty &amp; permit the Churchs to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, &amp; beleive otherwiſe, then he had taught by his Apoſtles. Is it probable, that all Churchs should by error fall into one &amp; the ſame opinion? when there are ſoe many by ways, thoſe who looſe the hygh way wonld ſcarce wander into the ſame error. Soe that certainly what is ſound one &amp; the ſame in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churchs is no ertor newly invented, but it is faith of old delivered.</hi> Thus Tertullian. Anſwer you to his diſcourſe, if you can.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 108. <hi>A late ingenious writer, whoſe ſincere zeale had drawne cenſures on himſelf, &amp; his booke, tooke away to repayre his reputation by a new method of proving</hi> Popish doctrines <hi>that they had them from their Anceſtors, they from theirs. But this pretence hath beene baffled by Mr. Claud, as all know, who have beene ſoe happy as to reade his workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. I am perſwaded, that your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates will ſcarce think it <hi>ſincere zeale</hi> in Monſr. <hi>Arnaud</hi> (of him you ſpeake) that the ſtood out ſolong againſt <hi>his ſpirituall &amp; temporall Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.</hi> But let that paſſe.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102635:143"/>
                  <hi>Arnaud invented it. Mr. Tho. White</hi> had it before <hi>Arnaud: Mr. Fisher</hi> a Jeſuit, before T. W. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin before him: &amp; <hi>S. Auſtin, S. Stephen</hi> Pope, &amp; <hi>Tertullian,</hi> before them all. I have reade Mr. Claude's workes, &amp; was far from finding ſoe much ſatisfaction, as you promiſe your Reader, I beleive rather uppon heare ſay, then on your owne experience. Nay I have from one of the eminenteſt wits, of the french <hi>Hugenots,</hi> that <hi>Claud</hi> was not much eſteemed a mongſt his owne for thoſe workes: which would have beene neglected, had not Arnaud's enemys commended them. You ſay <hi>Claud Buſſled him:</hi> others are of a different opinion. I confeſſe <hi>Mr. Arnaud,</hi> though very learned, yet ſeemed not qualifyed to manage a controverſy <hi>in defence</hi> of <hi>Church-Authority &amp; Tradition:</hi> having (as much as lay in him) weakened both, by his writings, &amp; practice, during the time he ſtood out againſt the <hi>Cenſure</hi> &amp; the <hi>Formula.</hi> Which gave ſuch advantage to <hi>Mr. Claude,</hi> who indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly gathered together, &amp; cunningly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned uppon him his owne arguments) that ſome thought he foyled his adverſary. Yet without any prejudice to the <hi>Catholick cauſe,</hi> which is not concerned in <hi>Mr. Arnaud's perſonall faylings.</hi>

This is an argument that changes cannot happen without ſome notice taken of them: As in this, we know when it begun (with the <hi>ſchooles</hi>) who oppoſed it, (the <hi>Huſſits</hi>) what Councill commanded it, &amp; condemne its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, that of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> Which confirmes our Rule, that when none of this appeares, there hath beene no change,</p>

               <p>G. B. pag. 123. <hi>The Papiſt Church pretends to revelations for ſome of her moſt doubtfull opinions: which are the viſions &amp; extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations of ſome of their Saints, from which they vouch a Divine confirmation to their doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. If you know of any decree made in matter of faith, uppon a private <hi>revelation,</hi> shew it. Till you doe ſo, I will not beleive it. S. Thomas 1. p. q. 1. a. 8. ad 2. abſolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all private revelations from grounding Faith. <hi>Innititur Fides noſtra revelationl factae Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolis &amp; Prophet is; non autem revelationi, ſi qua fuit aliis Doctoribus factae.

               <p>ANS. S. Paul ſays that he <hi>had</hi> 14. <hi>yeares</hi> before that greate <hi>revelation;</hi> but he never ſayd, he had noe others ether before or after. And that <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> were not ſoe extraordinary in his days, as you think not only amongſt the Apoſtles; but ever amongſt ordinary Chriſtians, you many learne out of S.

               <p>G. B. pag. 124. <hi>Are they not credible storyes, of Chriſt's appearing to ſome of their shee Saints, &amp; kiſſing them, being marryed to them, &amp;c.</hi>

Yet to free you from feare of illuſions (in thoſe viſits) from bad ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, know (&amp; I wonder any one, who reades the ſcripture can be Ignorant of it) that there is a ſpirituall <hi>contract</hi> betwixt Chriſt, &amp; the Church: Item betwixt him &amp; every Pious ſoul: that this contract is called a <hi>marriage:</hi> that on this ſcore ſins of ſuch ſouls againſt their ſpouſe are called <hi>Adulterys,</hi> &amp; themſelves <hi>Adultereſſes.</hi> If you have any <hi>Remembrance,</hi> theſe hints will bring to mind a number of Texts of Scripture, which deliver what you ſcoffe at.

               </p>
               <p>ANS. We build not our Faith on any of their Revelations, you ſpeake of: ſo this hint is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to rhe purpoſe. If we did, Miracles are not here wanting, viz, the change of men's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves ether from good to better, or at leaſt from bad, to Good. Which ſufficiently proves the goodneſſe of the Spirit appearing, above all your frivolous exceptions. And if other miracles are neceſſary, thoſe are many times granted too.</p>
               <p>G. B. p. 126. <hi>Was it not aworthy peice of the Angelicall ministration, for Angels to go trotting over ſea, &amp; Land, with a Loade of Timber &amp; Stones of the Virgins Houſe to Loretto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. Whither they <hi>trotted,</hi> or <hi>ambled,</hi> I doubt not, but that <hi>peice of miniſtration</hi> was more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to thoſe B.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102635:147"/>Truth. Sin</hi> I know they abhorre: other things are indifferent to them; &amp; all are welcome, when commanded.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 128. <hi>The Miracles of Rome are not heard of till ſome ages, at leaſt yeares be paſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. This is not tru. They are all very ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immediatly examined by authority from the <hi>ordinary:</hi> &amp; then publisht. See that done at Gant uppon <hi>D. Mary minshall</hi> approved by the Bishop shortly. after it paſt.</p>
               <p>G. B Ibidem. <hi>It is the intereſt of Rome to have them all beleived, without once queſtioning them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. Rome has no intereſt, but that Truth find place, &amp; God by glorifyed. If you conſider how ſtrictly thoſe of the <hi>Portugueſe nun</hi> were examined, &amp; how ſincerely the cheate was publisht, you will acknowledge, that our church doth not countenance any deceipt in this, nor think it her <hi>intereſt,</hi> that <hi>all should be beleived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>G. B. Ibidem. <hi>How comes it, that in hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call countryes, where there is more neede of thoſe miracles, &amp; where they myght be more irrefragably proved if tru, none of theſe myghty workes doe shew themſelves forth?</hi>
               </p>

Now miracles are very eſſicacious meanes, but not the only motives to bring us to faith, &amp; by conſequence not abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely neceſſary. The Apoſtle had a Power to work miracles, &amp; had a greate proportion of learning, yet he uſed nether for converſion of the world, when worldly men demanded it 1. Cor. 1.22. <hi>Iudaei ſigna petunt, Graeci ſapientiam quaerunt, Nos autem praedicamus Christu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Crucifixum, Iudaeis quidem ſcandalum, Gentibus autem ſtultitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

No, <hi>but we preach Chriſt crucifyed, aſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall to the Iews, &amp; folly to the Greekes.</hi> Both tempted God, as the Scribes did, &amp; you do: &amp; nether obtained, what they demanded. In deed thoſe that will shut their eyes, to all other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, would eaſily baffle the conviction of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, ether ſaying they are naturall workes, or attribute them to Magicke.

But in the following chapt. 26. p. 336. he explicates his meaning, which was to reject only ſuch <hi>clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Traditions,</hi> as should be contrary to the Word, or Doctrine publickly preached. And we ſay the ſame.</p>
               <p>G. B. p. 132. <hi>Theſe are practiſes far different from the methode of the Apoſtles in preaching the Ghoſpel, who with held nothing of the counſell of God from the People.</hi>

Tim. 2.2.</p>
               <p>Now though according to the practice of the Apoſtles, the <hi>People</hi> amongſt us are not made, <hi>Teachers, Paſtors, Prophets,</hi> &amp; <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yet all even to the meaneſt <hi>Artiſan</hi> have <hi>inſtructions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> What they are bound <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive,</hi> what they are <hi>to hope for,</hi> &amp; what <hi>to doe.</hi> &amp; what neede of more?</p>
               <p>If any amongſt us will undergo the labour of Studys, the greateſt myſteryes of our <hi>Faith</hi> are obvious to him: our Scriptures, our Councils, our Decretalls, our Fathers, our Eccleſiaſticall, &amp; Prophane Hyſtorys, our Divines, &amp; our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers are extant in our Stationers shops; as well for the uſe of the meaneſt Chriſtian, as of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102635:151"/>the Pope, Cardinalls, or Bihops. What is then concealed from them, which may ground your Accuſation?</p>
               <p>Our procedure in this is ſo connaturall, that I am perſwaded it cannot but be your owne practice. The Inglish Church hath drawne to ſome few heades thoſe points of Faith which shee thinks neceſſary to ſalvation, &amp; delivers them to all in her <hi>Catechiſme.</hi> As for the others, contained ether in the <hi>Bible,</hi> or in the <hi>Nicene</hi> &amp; <hi>Athanaſian Creedes,</hi> or in the four firſt Generall <hi>Councills,</hi> she Leaves it to her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to ſeeke them out themſelves, if they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve will &amp; convenience, or to receivethem from their <hi>Miniſters:</hi> &amp; I do not ſee how any Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of a Church can proceede otherwiſe.

God is my witneſſe, how theſe thoughts have entertained me with horrour, &amp; regret, all the while I have conſidered them: &amp; it is not without the greateſt Antipathy to my nature imaginable, that I have payd this duty to Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANS. Here you give a very artificiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of all you had ſayd before: that you tinder tooke this taske with greate reluctance, &amp; carryed it on with greife &amp; ſorrow: <hi>vouch God as witneſſe</hi> of he truth of this ſuſpecting I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as you had reaſon, your bare word would ſcarce be received, whileſt ſoe many pregnant proofes ſtand for the contrary.</p>
               <p>For firſt: your Religion doth not inſpire ſuch a ſpirit of mortification, as to engage her children in paine full &amp; ſorrowfull actions, for any time at all, much leſſe for ſoe long a time as is neceſſary for compoſing a booke of ſoe various matter. And for your perſon, I doe not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:102635:155"/>heare, that you ſeeke ſoe much occaſions of Greife.</p>
               <p>Secondly: thoſe who with ſorrow &amp; unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly think of others faults, avoyde thoſe uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, &amp; entertaine others of their vertues. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> is the thing all men commonly ſeeke, even in their greife.

               <p>Thirdly, thoſe who are truly ſorry for their neyghbours faults, doe not eaſily entertaine falſe reports of them: are unwilling without pregnant proofes, to harbour any bad opinion of them, or give credit to bad reports concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them.

And can any body perſwade himſelf, our errours &amp; faults afflict you, when you labour ſo hard to find them? And faine them your ſelfe rather then miſſe of them? I cannot <hi>tell to what better to compare this proceeding</hi> (if your greiſe were reall) <hi>then to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who having drest up a Puppet, fancy it ſicke, then dead: &amp; then fall a crying, as if it really were ſoe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly your manner of writing is too artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall for Greife: it is not ſoe ſerious, &amp; grave as thoſe are which that Paſſion dictates. It is ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſticall, inſulting sharpe, biting, in a word ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyricall, no ſigne of mercy, compaſſion, be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anings, bewaylings, &amp;c, But only when you call to mind your text, or ſtrive to get your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders favour, by pretending to greive for our faults. Soe that, did you not tell us of it, we should rather gueſſe any other paſſion predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in you, then Greife.

               <p> Laſtly this very proteſtation gives an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſuſpect your innocency, according to the Rule of the law. <hi>Excuſatio non petita, accuſatio manifeſta.

               <p>Hence I feare moſt indifferent Readers will think, that you never gave greater ground to ſuſpect your ingenuity, then now.

               <p>Now this poſſibility of miſtakes, &amp; errour, reaches to our harts, which are hidden not only from our neyghbours, but even from our ſelves, whileſt we take thoughts for reſolutions, &amp; tranſitory purpoſes for ſet led deſignes.

               <p>ANS. Your <hi>meekeneſſe</hi> diſcovers it ſelfe more &amp; more. Before you propoſed our <hi>Banishment</hi> from the Country, which God appointed us for this life, by ordring in it our birth: now you banish us from Heaven, our tru Country: Soe that in the midſt of your kindneſſe, you deſigne us the Punishment of <hi>Cain</hi> in this world, &amp; that of the <hi>Devils</hi> in the next.

               </p>
               <p>Imprimis they had a greate motive to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the whole Reformation, becauſe the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion opf it was evidently reprochfull. In Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Luther's motive was emulation betwixt his order, &amp; the Dominicans, &amp; Enuy, that theſe later should have the preaching of the Jubily. In Ingland luſt begun it under Henry VIII. &amp; Avarice, &amp; Pride compleated it under Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward VI.</p>
               <p>By whome was is moſt hotly embraced, &amp; promoted? By Apoſtatas, in whome the flesh prevailed over the ſpirit: &amp; the firſt ſtep they made, was shaking of the yoke of obedience to their lawfull ſuperiors, to become <hi>independants.</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:102635:158"/>This is one ſacriledge, which was accompanyed with two others, breaking their vows of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity</hi> &amp; <hi>Poverty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What motives did they uſe, to draw Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to joyne with them? Propoſe Liberty from all Eccleſiaſticall laws, that were any way bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome, or contrary to ſenſuality, as faſting praying on certaine days, Pennances, &amp;c. free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men from the obligation of Divine laws, by teaching they were impoſſible, &amp; rejecting ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of them in particular, as that for <hi>Confeſsion.</hi> Indulging ſenſualitys, trampling on all that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med burthenſome, under pretence of <hi>Chriſtian liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What effects followed the Reformation? A neglect of god's counſels, an inſenſibility of his Inſpirations, a contempt of Religion, an unwillingneſſe to be ruled, Rebellion in Church &amp; ſtate, a looſing of the ſpirit of Prayer, a ſlygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all good workes &amp; anentire abandoning the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to bad ones. The lyght of the Ghoſpel promiſt, &amp; that darkned with irreligious inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, the word of God held forth, &amp; a greate part of it cut off. A Reformation preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Church, &amp; the Church robbed of its revenues: the Church worship purged, &amp; the cheife action of it, <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> abolisht, the glory of God promiſt, &amp; his ſacred name by blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my prophaned. <hi>Faith</hi> ſoe commended, as by it <hi>Hope</hi> was deſtroyed by <hi>Preſumption,</hi> &amp; <hi>Charity</hi> by <hi>Schiſme.</hi> In fine, if any thing like zeale appeared
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102635:159"/>in the firſt times of Reformation, it shewed it ſelfe by Avarice, Rapine, Sacriledge, Pride, Diſſenſions, Schiſmes, Rebellious, Incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Drunkenneſſe, in a word Libertiniſme. Which the ſincerer part of your communion deplore with tru teares; not with ſuch, as you sheed for our errours. If theſe are the <hi>workes of sheepe,</hi> what are <hi>the workes of wolues?</hi> And if by <hi>workes we muſt, Iudge of men,</hi> what could they ſay of theſe <hi>Reformers?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Letus lay aſide what is paſt, &amp; looke on what is preſent: Is it not tru, that though you talke much of Chriſtianity, yet all markes of it ſeeme blotted out of the lives of your flock? That therenever was more impurity in marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, more corruption in familyes, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery in youth, more ambition amongſt the rich, more Pride amongſt the Gentry, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Dishoneſty in commerce, more ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in marchandiſes, more deceipt amongſt tradeſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, more intemperance amongſt all? That fornication is thought a peccadillo; adultery, good fortune: Chaſtity a reproach te the ſex: cheating &amp; treachery, court vertu: Impiety &amp; libertiniſme, ſtrength of wit: Oathes &amp; blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemys, or naments of our language: perpetuall gaming, a lawfull divertiſment for men: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their husbands, neglect of the Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their children, &amp; of the care of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milys, a priviledge of women who have ſome advantage of birth, &amp; fortune: &amp; Drunkeneſſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102635:159"/>for all who have time &amp; mony to caſt away? The prodigious numbers of houſes deſigned for tippling is a ſufficient co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>viction of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneſſe of this vice: there being more in <hi>London</hi> alone, then in any ten <hi>Catholicks townes</hi> in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, &amp; probably more then ſerved the whole kingdome in Catholick times: which are ſo many nurſeryes of Idleneſſe, whence all vices flow: &amp; the thriving condition, they all live in, shews which may the riches of the nation goe &amp; on what their harts are ſetled.</p>
               <p>You will ſay theſe are faults of the <hi>Reformers;</hi> but not of your <hi>reformation.</hi> But in this you are miſtaken: for it comes from the very ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all parts of your reformation: ſoe that if any do well, it is to be attribued to the goodneſſe of their nature: If ill, it is to be charged uppon your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: which hath retrenched, on ſeverall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, almoſt all helpes of Devotion.</p>
               <p>Chriſt to apply to us the merits of his paſſion, inſtituted ſeven Sacraments, which are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the Cat. Church. To regenerate us, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme:</hi> to ſtrengthen us in faith, <hi>Confirmation:</hi> to nourisb our ſouls, <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> to reſtore us to God's grace, if by frailty we have loſt it, <hi>Pennance:</hi> to prepare us for a paſſage to the other world, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame-unction:</hi> to confer grace neceſſary for a Church-man, or a marryed-man. <hi>Order,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.</hi> Of thoſe you have cut off five: &amp; of the two remaining, that of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which Chriſt ſayd was his <hi>body</hi> &amp; <hi>Blood,</hi> you make only
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102635:160"/>a bit of Breade, &amp; ſpoone full of wine.</p>
               <p>The Catholicks have every day the unbloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſacrifice of the Altar offred, at which they can aſ2iſt: they are taught that maſſe is compoſed out of the law, &amp;p Prophets, the Ghoſpel, &amp; Canonicall Epiſtles: that it is a ſummary of the life of Chriſt, &amp; commemoration of his death: that when they ſee the ſacred hoſt elevated, they muſt call to mind his elevation on the Croſſe for their ſakes: &amp; that they muſt offer him &amp; themſelves, with him, to God the father: As S. Auſtin teaches us l. 10. de Civit. Dei c. 20. This Dayly ſacriſice you have cut off, having ſomething in Cathedralls on ſundays, in other Churchs ſeldome. Soe the wholé weeke in all places, &amp; a greate part of the yeare in moſt places, paſſes with out that greate exercice for your devotion.</p>
               <p>Ceremonyes in divineſervice are neceſſary to fix our Phancy on the things in hand, &amp; to helpe to rayſe our ſoul to God. This they doe firſt by their ſignification, as knocking our Breaſt is a figne of greife, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trition: kneeling &amp; bowing of our adoration of God: lifting up hands &amp; eyes to Heaven, of rayſing our wills to God, &amp;c. They likewiſe encreaſe within us thoſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, they ſignify, by a ſympathy betwixt the ſoul, &amp; body. Theſe you have retrencht, as ſuperſtitious, which hath opened a dore to the contempt of your holy ſervice, &amp; places, where it is celebrated, to which many of you shew
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102635:160"/>little more reſpect, then at other civill actions: nay many would not enter into a freinds houſe with ſoe little reſpect as they shew, entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>G.P. pag. 135. <hi>Religion conſiſts in few things.</hi> Tis tru, nay it conſiſtes in one thing, (as to its perfection) <hi>the love of God above all things.</hi> But what then? are helpes to ſtirre up that love of God to be neglected? It is Phariſaicall to place our confidence in the ceremonyes, or conſider them as the ſubſtance of Religion; but to looke on them as its ornaments &amp; meanes to ſtirre up &amp; ſtrike good purpoſes deeper into our harts, why should it be misliked? The wiſer of your brethren in france acknowledge, &amp; bewayle the want of them: Soe will you if you conſider it well.</p>
               <p>Catholicks have an unqueſtionable <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> for if we have none, yours muſt fall to the ground, you having received yours from us. Yours is not only queſtionable; but queſtioned actually &amp; with ſeeming probability denyed by Cath. 1. for want of a due miniſter, A Bishop. 2. for want of due matter &amp; forme. 3. for want of due intention for your Bishops owning no <hi>ſacrifice of the new law,</hi> could not intend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre a Power to offer <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> which is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to <hi>Preiſthood.</hi> They were confirmed in their opinions of your want of Ordination, by your Owning Communion with thoſe reformed Churchs in France &amp; Holland, which have no
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:102635:161"/>lawfull ordination according to your principles: your directing yours to their Churchs, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to receive the Sacraments from them: &amp; admitting thoſe Miniſters to the Miniſtry amongſt ou, without any new Ordination.</p>
               <p>To conclude they had thoſe ſame motives to continue in the Communion of the Catholick Church, which S. Auſtin had: which he relates I. contra Epiſt. Fundam. c. 4. <hi>Tenet conſenſio po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulorum &amp; gentium, tenet auctoritas miraculis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choata, ſpe nutrita, charitate aucta, vetuſtate fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata: tenet ab ipſa Sede Petri cui paſcendas oves poſt Reſurrectionem Dominus commendavit, uſque ad praeſentem Epiſcopatum ſucceſſio Sacerdotum. Tenet poſtremò ipſum Catholicae nomen, quod non ſine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ inter tam multas haereſes ſic iſta Eccleſia ſola ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuiut, ut .... Apud vos autem, ubi nihil horum eſt, ſola perſonat veritatis pollicitatio. I am retained in the Catholick Church, by the conſent of nations, by an authority begun with miracles, nourisht with hope, encreaſed by charity, eſtablisht by antiquity. I am retained by a ſucceſſion of Preiſt: beginning from S. Peter (to whome our Lord after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection commended the feeding of his sheepe) untill this preſent Pope,</hi> Innocent XI. <hi>Lastly I am retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the very name of Catholick, which with greate reaſon, amongſt ſoe many ſects, this Church alone obtaines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What have you to oppoſe againſt ſuch ſtrong motives? <hi>Scripture</hi> &amp; the <hi>Ghoſpel:</hi> which if cleere for you, ought without doubt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:102635:161"/>before all thoſe other motives. But they found this very <hi>Ghoſpel</hi> this <hi>Scripture</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in their favour, &amp; againſt you. <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſays the Scripture: <hi>It is not Chriſt's body,</hi> ſay you. <hi>The commandments of God are not heavy,</hi> ſays the Scripture, <hi>The command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God are impoſsible,</hi> ſays you. <hi>A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is due to our Good workes,</hi> ſays the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>No workes of ours are meritorious, nay the beſt are ſins,</hi> ſay you. <hi>Faith without workes is dead,</hi> ſays the Scripture, &amp; you commend faith, ſo as to make all good workes be neglected. I grant, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you of late, doe not ſoe crudely te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach ſome of theſe doctrines, being asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their deformity. But you cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that they were taught by the firſt <hi>Reformers.</hi> Which was ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world, that Scripture gave no evident verdict for them: &amp; make all affrayd of theyr Reformation, who had a care of their ſouls.</p>

O that you did but ſee with what attention, &amp; reſpect they aſſiſt at thoſe Divine Myſterys: how with their knees on the ground, their eyes on the Altar, their hart in Heaven, they accompany the Preiſt, &amp; with him jointly make that obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, with what ſentiments they ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Chriſt preſent, &amp; deſire him to appeaſe his fathers wrath, for their ſins, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Paſſion: &amp; preſerve them from offending anew that day &amp; to bleſſe that days actions.

               <p>Have any by mortall ſin shut againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the gates of Heaven, which the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt opened: they ſtirre up a reall ſorrow for that offence of God, purpoſe

They diſcover to him all the wounds of their ſoul their moſt ſecret &amp; moſt reprochfull ſins, as to God himſelfe, whoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cegerent he is, being aſſured of an inviolable ſecret (&amp; itis doubtleſſe a perpetuall miracle, that amongſt ſoe many thouſands of Preiſts, not one ſhould be found faulty in this point) They harken to his advice, accept his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to faſt, pray, give almes, viſit Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſerve poore in Hoſpitals, or the like, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the condition of the Penitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.

If any notwithſtanding all theſe helpes to Piety continue obſtinate in their wickedneſſe, or adde more grevious ſins to thoſe they have committed; they are indeed tolerated in the feild of God, the Church, untill the time come deſigned for the ſeparation of the cockle from the good corne.

B. p. 145. <hi>A tentation,</hi> to become Papiſts, <hi>is the ſolitary &amp; retired houſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them for leading a devout, &amp; ſtrict life, &amp; the excellent bookes of Devotion have beene publisht by many of that communion.</hi> &amp; p. 147. <hi>I deny not that is the greateſt defect of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation t at there are not in it ſuch encouragements to a devout life.</hi> &amp; p. 148. <hi>It is not to be denyed, to be agreate defect, that we want recluſe hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. But it fixeth no imputation on our Church, her doctrine, or worship, that shee is ſoe poore, as not to be able to mantaine ſuch Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER This is as pretty a ſophiſme of <hi>non cauſa pro causâ,</hi> as I have ſeene. As if the ſmall number of Inglish Catholicks were richer then the whole body of Proteſtants; for we have founded many geate familyes of Religious: &amp; you with all your induſtry could never ſettle one. There are reaſons, for your Churchs being ſoe unſucceſſefull in theſe attempts, without doubt, as reall, &amp;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102635:165"/>tru, as that, which you give is falſe: &amp; it shall be my worke to lay them out before you.</p>
               <p>The firſt, &amp; cheifeſt reaſon, is a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God Almyghty uppon you, forbrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up, &amp; diſperſing ſoe many houſes of Piety. God was ſerved in thoſe houſes, he was offended with that ſacriledge, &amp; there fore denyes you that Bleſſing of which you are unworthy.</p>
               <p>A ſecond: each one had rather keepe his meanes to himſelf, then ſee them paſſe againſt his will to another lay family, for whome he hath nokindneſſe. If any give it to God, &amp; Religion, they deſigne it should continue there, which cannot be expected in Ingland, as long as the memory is fresh of Henry VIII. &amp; Elizabeth.</p>
               <p>A third: the foundation of your Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is inconſiſtent with a ſuperſtructure of Religion, or living in community together. Men cannot live together without a ſetled <hi>rule,</hi> or <hi>order,</hi> eſtablisht, peculiar to that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, &amp; proper for it. Your <hi>Reformation</hi> is inconſiſtent with this, it teaching to reject all humane injunctions, as contrary to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian liberty. When out of that principle you have taught men to deſpiſe all decrees even of generall counſils, received by the whole Church, &amp; confirmed by the practice of many ages, how can you hope, they
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:102635:166"/>should eſteeme Rules given by moderne new men?</p>
               <p>A fourth: your doctrine denying all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or Reward, due to our actions. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of advantage encourages us to labour: our induſtry is dulled aſſoone as thoſe vanish. S. Ambroſe thinks the Novatians unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who preacht Pennance, &amp; denyed the fruit of it, l. 1. de Poenit. c. 16. <hi>Fruſtra di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citis vos praedicare Poenitentiam, qui tollitis.</hi> &amp; lib. 2. c. 3. <hi>Merendi gratia Sacramenti, ad precandum impellimur: &amp; hoc auferre vultis, propter quod agitur Poenitentia? Tolle guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natori perveniendi ſpem, &amp; in mediis fluctibus incertus errabit. Tolle luctatori coronam, &amp; len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus jacebit in ſtadio: Tolle piſcatori capiendi eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicaciam, deſinet jactare retia.</hi> In hopes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at his Heaven the Pilot ſteeres his ship: the wraſtler ſtrives in hope to throw his adverſary: The fisher caſts his nets in hope of catching ſome fish. All theſe would relent, were they perſwaded the thing they aimed at were impoſſible. How then doe you expect, that men should practice good workes, when you teach them to hope for no good from them? It were indeede to be wisht, that men would ſerve God, for God without regarding any reward. But that is a perfection all doe not arrive to: And even the beſt are faine to uſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me other motives.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:102635:166"/>
               <p> A fifth: your clergy is utterly unfit to Direct, &amp; Inſtruct ſuch houſes: our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes have a greater influence on our neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, then our words. S. Hierome thought it incongruous, that a man, with a <hi>full belly</hi> should preach <hi>faſting,</hi> And how can a man preach chaſtity to others, who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes himſelf from the embraces of his wife, if he hath one, or hath his head full of Amourettes, &amp; deſignes to get one, if he be a batchelour?</p>
               <p>It is in vaine therefore that you ſeeke the advantage of thoſe with-drawing places from the noyſe, &amp; trouble of the world, to thoſe Devout Solitudes: your lives are not fit for them, your doctrine is inconſiſtent with them, &amp; your paſt actions have shut that dore of mercy unto you.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Bookes of Devotion:</hi> The Authour of the <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> ſays you have printed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſuch compoſed by ours under your owne names. Soe you hang us, &amp; cherish our writings, as the Jews ſtoned the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp; canonized their bookes. You owne we <hi>have many excellent Bookes;</hi> All the world ſees you have ſcarce any: nor can rationally hope for any. For</p>
               <p>He who writes a ſpirituall Booke, ought to aime at two things the firſt to inſtruct the underſtanding with divine &amp; eternall Truths. The ſecond, to move the will to a
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102635:167"/>hatred of ſin, a contempt of the world, &amp; to the love of God above all things. The firſt may be an effect of ſtudy: but the ſecond cannot be attained unto, unleſſe the Authour be ſuch himſelf. He muſt, as S. John, be<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Io. 5.35.</note> a <hi>Burning &amp;, shining lyght. Burne</hi> to God, by a tru &amp; unfeigned love of him, <hi>Shine</hi> to men, by the cleere truths, which he delivers. He muſt feele with in himſelfe thoſe motions, which he endeavours to communicate to his Reader. <hi>Si vis me flere dolendum eſt primum ipſi tibi.</hi> A ſoul poſſeſt with hope, with feare, with joy, with greife, with love, with hatred, in fine with any paſſion, doth expreſſe not only the thoughts; but the paſſion it ſelfe with tropes proper: by which meanes it not only informes the underſtanding, but alſo ſtirs the will of the hearer, or reader to like inclinations.</p>
               <p>Reade Seneca's epiſtles, or other morall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, or Cicero's, you shall find agreate many excellent Truths. Yet I never knew any man the better in his morality for them: As they themſelves notwithſtanding thoſe lyghts, were farre from being <hi>Good men,</hi> as you may ſee in Lactantius l. 3. divin. Inſtit. from the 13. Chapter. On the contrary the reading of Saint's workes hath a greate force to move us to Good. S. Auſtin l. 8. Confeſſ. cap. 6. ſays ſome were converted, by reading the life of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102635:167"/>S. Antony, ſeverall have have taken ſerious reſolutions of leading a Chriſtian life, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe <hi>Confeſſions.</hi> And I have knowne Several moved to love mentall Prayer, by Reading <hi>S. Tereſa's</hi> workes: &amp; to the love of God, by uſing thoſe of <hi>S. Francis de Sales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a great defect in all our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant writers. I will inſtance in two, who ſeeme each in his kind to overtop his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freres, quantum lenta ſolentinter viburna Cupreſſi.</hi> The one Bishop Andrews, who by diviſions &amp; ſubdiviſions inſtructs well, only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>verborum minutiis rerum pondera frangit.</hi> The other is the Authour <hi>of the whole duty of man:</hi> who hath many excellent Truths, &amp; very practicall, as well as the firſt: yet ſeeme not to move the will, becauſe of their cold way of treating their doctrines. <hi>They Shine,</hi> but they doe not <hi>Burne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This heate is not to be attained unto but by Prayer. Which inflames our hart, with the love of God (<hi>In meditatione meâ exardeſcet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> Pſal. 38.4.) It is this love, which vnites us to God: &amp; this union makes us capable of doing greate things. For an inſtrument muſt be in the hand of the work man, to doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly what is intended: if it be diſtant from him, and not held, but by a ſmall thred, the work will be difficult, &amp; imperfect, if there can be any. We are all the inſtruments of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:102635:168"/>God in order to all good workes eſpecially in writing ſpirituall bookes, in which, if there is any thing good, it muſt come from God the fountaine of all good.</p>

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:102635:169"/>fishes: foolish virgins, as well as wiſe. That as S. Auſtin<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Auguſt Epiſt. 137.</note> obſerves, we cannot hope that in any Congregation conſiſting of many perſons, all should be greate Saints, ſeing in the Ark of Noe of eyght perſons one <hi>(Cham)</hi> was accurſt: that out of Abraham's family <hi>Iſmael</hi> was caſt: that in Iſaac's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated: in Jacob's <hi>Ruben</hi> defiled his father's bed. In David's one ſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted inceſt, &amp; another turned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell. Amongſt the Apoſtles there was one <hi>Iudas.</hi> In the earthly Paradice Adam fell; &amp; in Heaven the Angels ſinned. Hence it is no reproach to any Congregation, to have ſome bad livers ſometimes diſcovered in it, provided its eſtablisht laws doe not abette the evill, nor its doctrine encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to it. J owneſome ill livers in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church, as well as in yours. But we have many greate Saints who appeaſe God's wrath; &amp; you have none. We muſt ſee whither doctrines foſter Impiety? you ſay ours: &amp; I have, I think, convinced y our errour; we ſay yours, &amp; thus we prove it.</p>
               <p>Firſt: nothing is embraced or aimed at by our will, but what is good, &amp; poſſible to be obtained. It is not credible that any man in his wits, will ſeriouſly ſet himſelf to make a ladder, to reach the moone, or
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:102635:170"/>bootes to wade from Ingland to Jamaica: both being Looked on, as impoſſible, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the heygth of the moorce, &amp; the bredth, &amp; depth of thoſe ſeas. Wherefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Proteſtant doctrine, teaching that the commandments of God are impoſſible, is deſtructive to all ſerious endeavours to kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe them.</p>
               <p>How contrary to this was the diſcourſe of Moyſes<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Deut. 30.11.</note> when he perſwaded the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits to the obſervance of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments becauſe they were not difficult, the things commanded being nether in Heaven, nor within the Earth, nor in remote re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, that is to ſay, nether ſoe hygh, nor ſoe low, nor ſoe remote, as to be out of their reach; but that they were in their hart, &amp; mouth, that is to ſay very neere or eaſy. S. John, 1. Jo 5.3. to the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſayd <hi>the Commandments were lyght,</hi> with this motive we encourage ours.</p>
               <p>Two things may be anſwered to this reaſon: firſt that ſome of ours have taught that doctrine, &amp; ſecondly that ſome of yours doe not teach it. To the firſt I reply, that <hi>I anſenius</hi> indeed did hold it: but was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly condemned by the Pope, &amp; the whole Church: ſoe his doctrine doth not diſcourage ours. And to the ſecond: your
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:102635:170"/>Church never made any ſolemne decree againſt it; nay it ownes Communion with thoſe who teach it: ſoe the diſcouragement lyes with you.</p>
               <p>Secondly your exceſſive exagerations of faith as all ſufficient to ſalvation, &amp; your neglect of other vertues, &amp; good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, may encline to faith; but ſtirres up to no labour for other vertues, as being of no neceſſity, &amp; no greate uſe: now we pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce faith in the rank S. Paul aſſignes it,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">1. Cor. 12.</note> at the feete of Charity: &amp; with S. James we teach, that<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iac. 2.26.</note> 
                  <hi>with out workes, it is dead.</hi> We owne with the Apoſtle, that without <hi>Faith</hi> nothing can be done in order to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bliſſe, (becauſe<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Heb. 11.6.</note> 
                  <hi>it impoſſible to pleaſe God without it,</hi>) &amp; with it <hi>alone</hi> nothing conſiderable is done. Hence we teach our People too keepe their Faith, as the Apple of their eye, but withall to cherish <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> as their Hart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: Hope of advantage is a greate ſpurre to vertu, this encourages the ſouldier in his battells, the marchant is his voyages, the Husband man in his labours: whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours would ſlacken was there no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, no gaine by marchandiſe, nor victory, to be hoped for, Now we teach, that through the Paſſion of Chriſt, &amp; by the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:102635:171"/>promiſe of God, a reward is due to good workes; &amp; you deny this, pretending that nothing is due to the beſt of them, but Hell, &amp; damnation, they being all ſins. Soe our doctrine encourages to good workes, &amp; yours dishartens them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly: what ſoever doctrine dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishs the feare of the punishment due to ſin, is contrary to vertu, becauſe that feare is a greate curbe to our Paſſions. Now your doctrine doth diminish that feare, for you teach that faith ſecures to you your <hi>act of oblivion,</hi> your full pardon, ſoe that thoſe who beleive ſoundly, neede feare nothing: Faith having a vertu to blot out all ſins.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 154. <hi>We cannot be charged, for having taught our People to breake any one Commandment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. You ſeeme charged for teaching them indirectly, to breake them all: ſaying the keeping them is impoſsible, in it ſelfe, fruitleſſe if they should be kept, &amp; their breach not prejudiciall.</p>
               <p>G. B. pag. 160. <hi>Bad practices may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish matter for regret; but not for ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANSWER. It is tru, when &amp; where prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion are contrary to ſuch prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices; But when theſe bad cuſtomes are naturall ſequels of the doctrine, &amp; neceſſarily
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:102635:171"/>flow from it, not only the practices are to be deteſted, but likewiſe the doctrine whence they flow, is to be abhorred as pernicious to ſouls, &amp; the Church which teaches them as doctrine ether <hi>neceſſary to be beleived,</hi> or even <hi>probable in practice,</hi> what ſoever Church it be, is to be forſaken as the <hi>Chaire of Peſtilence.</hi>

            <p>I had finisht this treatiſe, before I ſaw your learned worke againſt <hi>Atheiſme:</hi> I ſeldome read any booke, with greater deſire to learne from it: Your Candour diſcovered in your Preface by owning, &amp; correcting a miſtake, encreaſed my opinion of your abyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, &amp; my hopes of new lyghts in obſcure matters, from ſo greate labour, accompanyed with ſuch <hi>ſincerity.</hi> The firſt leſſon of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome is to ſpeake of nothing, but what we underſtand perfectly. The ſecond is to correct Willingly, what is unadviſedly ſpoken. S. Aug. epiſt. 7. having ſayd that <hi>Cicero</hi> would never recall any thing, he had once ſpoken, ſays that he thinks that no ſigne of a Wiſe-man. <hi>Haec laus, quamvis praeclariſsima videatur, tamen cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibilior

            <pb n="335" facs="tcp:102635:178"/>
            <p> You owne ſome very few Philoſophers to have thought God to be corporall, viz, <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus, Strato, </hi> but that the major part belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him a pure ſpirit, &amp; <hi>adored the only tru God,</hi> under the names, <hi>Iupiter, Minerva, Oſyris,</hi> or <hi>Venus.</hi> I ſayd with the ancient Fathers, &amp; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, that althô all Pagans, (nay all men) had naturally a knowledge of the tru God; yet thoſe, they adored, were Men. To the proofes alleadged above, I adde now four. 1. Taken from the diverſity of their ſexes. 2. From their Generation. 3. From their Death. 4. From their Rites.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The different ſexes of the Pagan Deitys is a convincing proofe, that they were not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; but Men &amp; women, or at leaſt Males &amp; Females, &amp; by conſequence corporall. This reaſon takes up a greate part of Arnobius's third booke, from pag. 46. where he begins with theſe words: <hi>Adduci primum hoc ut creda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, non poſſumus, immortalem illam, praeſtantiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam<expan>
                     <am>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> naturam diviſame eſſe per ſexus.</hi> And he ſays, that <hi>Cicero</hi> having ingenuouſly profeſt his diſlike of this, the Pagans deſigned to get his workes abolisht by the Senate, as confirming Chriſtian Religion, &amp; deſtroying ancient tru Paganiſme. <hi>Oportere ſtatui per Senatum, abole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur ut haec ſcripta, quibus Chriſtiana comprobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; vetuſtatis opprimatur auctoritas.</hi> So eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall to <hi>Paganiſme</hi> was this diverſity of ſexes.

Auſtin's opinion, of the Pagan Gods: viz, that in <hi>reall Truth</hi> they had been men, even
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102635:180"/>
               <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe, that they were, dead as other Men, that they had beene buryed: &amp; that in <hi>reall Truth,</hi> their ſepulchers were to be ſeene.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Their Rites, or Ceremonyes, shew them to be dead men, as I have ſayd. Baruch 6.30. 31. deſcribes them in this manner: <hi>Sacerdotes ſedent habentes tunicas ſciſſas, &amp; capita &amp; barbam raſam, quorum capita nuda ſunt. Rugiunt claman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes contra Deos ſuos, tanquam in coenâ mortui.</hi> Which probably was the reaſon, wherefore ſome of theſe things were forbidden to Preiſts of the old law, Leu. 10.6. &amp; to all the Jews Deut. 14 1. Hence proceeded that ordinary Check of the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the Pagans; that they should not lament them, if they were Gods, nor adore them, if they were men. Which ſeemes borrowed of <hi>Xenophanes</hi> the Colopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, who ſayd, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Accordingly the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poet very judiciouſly inferred, that <hi>Oſiris</hi> was a man, becauſe his Preiſts lamented him. <hi>Et quem tu plangens hominem teſtaris Oſyrim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee, Sir, that the Pagan Gods were men: viz, <hi>Iupiter, Iuno, Minerva,</hi> &amp; <hi>Venus,</hi> were ſuch, as well as <hi>Quirinus,</hi> or <hi>Flora.</hi> And that Jupiter himſelf was perſonated by a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Divill appeares. 1. By his owne confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. 2. By his permitting the cult of <hi>Priapus, Venus, </hi> &amp; oppoſing none, but that of the trv God. 3. By the filthy ſportes he exacted,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:102635:180"/>which were incentives to debauchery. Hence Tertullian l. ad Scapulam c. 2. p. 129. ſays, that the Pagans knew naturally the God of Chriſtians, but adored only thoſe whome the Chriſtians knew to be Divils. <hi>Nos unum Deum colimus, quem omnes naturaliter noſtis. Coeteros &amp; ipſi putatis Deos eſſe, quos nos Daemones ſcimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You make two objections, which I have not yet anſwered. The 1. pag. 452. Jupiter is called <hi>omnipotent.</hi> ANS. It is tru, the Pagans tooke him to be the <hi>Aether,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>Euripides,</hi> &amp; that is by <hi>the Poet</hi> called <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,</hi> l. 2. Georg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tum Pater omnipotens faecundis imbribus Aether Conjugis in gremium laetae deſcendit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 2. pag. 453. when Chriſtians had obtained rayne, <hi>Populus ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You myght as well ſay that man was <hi>Vigil,</hi> who owned his verſes, &amp; received a reward for them. Tertul, Apolog. c. 40. pag. 71. ſays: <hi>Cùm miſericordiam extorſerimus, Iupiter hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur.</hi> 
               <q>We Chriſtians obtaine of our God mercy, &amp; you Pagans aſcribe it to your Prayers, &amp; to <hi>Iupiter's</hi> goodneſſe.

            </p>
            <p>But if Jupiter be the tru God, tell us, which of the <hi>Iupiter's? Arnobius</hi> tells us, there have beene ſeverall: <hi>Voſſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Stillingf.</hi> reckon ſix: <hi>Varro</hi> in Tertul. Apolog. c. 14. pag. 44. reckons up 300. It would be pleaſant to heare theſe contend which shall be the tru God: as Arnobius lib. 4. pag. 59. &amp; 60. makes the <hi>Minerva's</hi> diſpute which of them is his daughter. He mentions there alſo three <hi>Dianas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Aeſculapiu's,</hi> four <hi>Vulcans,</hi> &amp; <hi>Venus's,</hi> five <hi>Bacchus's,</hi> ſix <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the name, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> pag. 451. you will not have it come from <hi>Iuvans Pater;</hi> but <hi>Iovis Pater: which, Iovis, without perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, is the very Hebrew</hi> Tetragrammaton, <hi>only altred by a Latin termination.</hi> And you ſend the two beſt Latiniſts, that <hi>Pagans</hi> &amp; <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ever had, <hi>Cicero</hi> &amp; <hi>Lactantius,</hi> to ſchoole, to learne <hi>Latin,</hi> for ignorance of this. I cannot ſubſcribe to you, 1. Becauſe this is warranted by no latin Authour. 2. The <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammaton</hi> is not knowne, as the Poliglot ſays prol. 8. n. 19. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſays it contained <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>four vowells;</hi> but what they were, or how pronounced, he doth not ſay: how can you build ſo confidently uppon ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain a foundation? 3. Many Latin names
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:102635:181"/>end in A. as <hi>Scaevola, Naſſica, Seneca, Galba, Caligula;</hi> none occurre to me, in Is: For <hi>Thais</hi> is of Greeke deſcent. So if the <hi>Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammaton</hi> was, what you to confidently ſay, the termination, <hi>Iehova,</hi> or <hi>Iova,</hi> had been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Latin, then <hi>Iovis.</hi> And we ſee, that if <hi>Iovis</hi> was ever in uſe, it was preſently layd by, as not <hi>Latin;</hi> when the names ending in A. were never changed.</p>
            <p>As here you make <hi>Cicero</hi> an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> p. 309. ſoe you give the like character of <hi>Plato in Greeke;</hi> in the Etymology of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> or <hi>Athena,</hi> which you bring from <hi>Neith,</hi> thus: <hi>Neith, Thien, Then, Thena, Athena.</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mething like this was this Etymology, of <hi>Hooper</hi> from <hi>King Pippin,</hi> thus: <hi>Hooper, Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Happer, Dapper, Diaper, Napkin, Nipkin, Pipkin, K.

            <p>
               <hi>Oſyris</hi> is alſo rayſed to a name of God, whome all hyſtorys ſpeake to have been a man, brother to <hi>Iſis,</hi> killed by her husband <hi>Typho</hi> for Inceſt with her, his body cut in <hi>peices,</hi> &amp; ſcattred in ſeverall places. That she with the helpe of <hi>Anubis,</hi> the Captaine of her guards, or her cheife <hi>Hunts</hi> man, found them all againe, except one, which Modeſty should have hindred het from ſeeking, as well as me from naming.

            </p>
            <p>Wherefore let us ſay with the Apoſtle Rom. 1. <hi>The Gentills knew God, but adored him not.</hi> All their Religion being taken up in the cult of Dead men.</p>
            <p>P. 451. You ſay the <hi>Roman Capitol</hi> was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the B. Trinity: of whome the Poet ſayd: <hi>Trina in Tarpeio fulgent conſortia Templo.</hi> viz. <hi>Iupiter, Minerva,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iuno,</hi> &amp; pag. 454. (ſo it should be, which is marked, 414.) you find another Trinity in Aegypt: <hi>Eicton, Hemphtha,</hi> &amp; <hi>Oſyris.</hi> As if by all threes, the Pagans underſtood the Trinity. Had the three
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:102635:182"/>
               <hi>Graces,</hi> three <hi>Parkes,</hi> three <hi>Gorgons,</hi> three <hi>Furyes,</hi> three <hi>Iudges,</hi> &amp; three <hi>Rivers</hi> in Hell, or three headed <hi>Cerberus</hi> or three bodyed <hi>Gerion</hi> occurred, you would have given us more markes of your Talent. To confute theſe dreames what I have ſayd is enough: ſeing thoſe perſons have once beene <hi>Men.</hi> That the <hi>Platonicians</hi> knew the myſtery of the B. Trinity, we learne of S. Auſtin: But that the Divine perſons, as <hi>One in Nature</hi> were expoſed even by them, to publicke veneration, I cannot beleive: for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers univerſally deny the Pagans to have adored the tru God.</p>
            <p>In your whole Booke you endeavour to prove, that the <hi>unity of God</hi> was a prime article of the Pagans Creede. I am ſorry ſo much labour should be loſt, as it muſt be, ſeing the thing is evidently falſe. To what I have ſayd c. 7. ſ. 5. I adde theſe proofes out of Origen who l. 1. cont.

               <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And l. 3. p. 155. he ſays the <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> or Phyloſophers, fell from the cult of one God, to <hi>Atheiſticall,</hi> or <hi>impious Polytheiſme:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Yet I am more concerned (for your owne ſake) for what you ſay pag. 256. then for any thing elſe: For there you aſſure, that <hi>Origen</hi> expreſſeth l. 5. cont. Celſ. <hi>Greate zeale againſt Chriſtians, uſing the Word Zeus, Iupiter,</hi> for the tru God: as acknowledging ſome Chriſtians to have uſed it. Whereas he ſays.

               </gap>. Your other ſlips ſeeme to be miſtakes; but this is a fault againſt that <hi>ſincerity,</hi> for which I commended you. Unleſſe (as I had rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive) you tooke that Citation uppon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of ſome other.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ianſenists</hi> have publisht whole bookes of Fathers to make way for ſome one ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: and written lives of Saints, for one paſſage reſembling their condition. Some gueſſe your booke to be of that nature: &amp; that <hi>Atheiſme</hi> is only a <hi>Stalking horſe,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veygh you unobſerved to your game, <hi>Popery:</hi> &amp; ſo your Booke will be like a <hi>Pike,</hi> which is a long piece of wood, to give motion to a little piece of Iron, which alone doth the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te. J rather beleive what you pretend, that it really is deſigned againſt <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> &amp; ſo, like a <hi>ſword,</hi> each part ſerves to wound your Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:102635:183"/>I wish you had not with it mingled thoſe points againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> which may reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the reſt: for men are apt to ſuſpect all, when they find themſelves once deceived. Irenaeus l. 2. c. 24. <hi>Non oportet univerſum ebibere mare cum qui vult diſcere, quoniam aqua ejus ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa eſt.</hi> Taſting here &amp; there of it, is a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient. In <hi>Nabuchodonoſor's</hi> ſtatu, there was a little dirt mingled with the Iron, braſſe, ſilver, &amp; Gold: all ſtrong or precious except that ſmall parcell. (which notwithſtanding its littleneſſe) occaſioned the ruine of all. God forbid any ſuch thing should fall on your Work, whoſe arguments againſt <hi>Atheiſme</hi> are unanſwerable: &amp; I have ſuch an eſteeme of labours againſt that hygheſt <hi>Impiety,</hi> that I should think my time well ſpent in ſecking citations, or playing the ſcribe for the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>But ſeing my condition doth not permit that: I will give you this advice (the only helpe withim my power,) that you conſider in the firſt place, whither a thing be tru, &amp; then, what uſe may be made of it, in order to other Truths. <hi>Non indiget Deus noſtro mendacio, ut pro illo loquamur dolos,</hi> ſays Job. 13.7. And S. Greg. l. 11. mor. c. 15. <hi>Veritas fulciri non quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit auxilio falſitatis.</hi> You thought doubtleſſe, it would be a greate conviction of <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> that all Religions, &amp; publicke laws had eſtablisht
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:102635:184"/>the contrary Truth. Now this being untru gives an advantage to an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> ſeing you build your aſſertion, on ſuch a quickſand. The Argument it more convincing when drawne from that greate Truth, delivered by Fathers, that all men have a naturall knowledge of one God, &amp; that ſo deepely engraven in them, that maugre all the ſtrength of laws, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of torments, the force of bad education, the Sophiſmes of Phyloſophers, the induſtry of wickedmen, deſirous to eaſe themſelves of the remorſe of conſcience, &amp; feare of a future Judge, &amp; the wiles of the Devil, it perſevered, &amp; shewed it ſelfe in certaine occaſions, &amp; ſo poſſeſt the hart, as to force the mouth to ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke out of its aboundance. Certainely this voice of nature triumphing over all the force &amp; Art of Men, &amp; Devils, is a cleerer Teſtimony of one God preſerving his poſſeſſion in, &amp; over his creatures, &amp; controuling all adjectitious Notions, then any Demonſtration man's wit can invent; eſpecially ſome <hi>Atheiſts</hi> pretending to invalidate this reaſon, from the notion we have of a God, by ſaying it comes not from Nature; but Education, &amp; Humane Laws: which Plea is evidently defeated by this Truth that Laws, Religion, &amp; Cuſtome were once againſt that <hi>Idea of one God</hi> (all concurring to eſtablish the contrary opinion of many Gods) which yet prevailed over them all. So the <hi>dirt</hi>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:102635:184"/>of <hi>untruths,</hi> mingled with the <hi>Gold</hi> of many greate, &amp; precious <hi>Truths,</hi> doth in reality weaken thoſe, which would be more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly drawne from, &amp; eſtablisht uppon our Principles.</p>
